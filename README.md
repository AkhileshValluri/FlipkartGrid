## Introduction
The Fashion Recommendation Engine aims to suggest clothing items and outfits to users based on their preferences and style. This project combines the capabilities of a fine-tuned OpenAI ChatGPT model and BERT embeddings to provide effective fashion recommendations through a natural language interaction.

## Features
- Personalized fashion recommendations
- Natural language interaction for user preferences
- Integration of fine-tuned ChatGPT for conversational recommendations
- Utilization of BERT embeddings for clothing item representations
- Vue frontend for user-friendly interaction


2. Interact with the system through the provided Vue frontend. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and follow the instructions in the frontend README to set it up.

## Model Architecture
The Fashion Recommendation Engine consists of two main components:
- **ChatGPT**: Fine-tuned OpenAI ChatGPT model for generating conversational recommendations.
- **BERT Embeddings**: BERT model for creating embeddings of clothing items for effective similarity comparison.

## Dataset
The project uses a fashion dataset containing clothing items, descriptions, and user preferences. The dataset was preprocessed to create training examples for fine-tuning ChatGPT and generating BERT embeddings.

## Training
1. Fine-tune ChatGPT:
- Details of ChatGPT fine-tuning process.

2. Generate BERT embeddings:
- Description of how BERT embeddings were extracted from clothing item descriptions.

## Results
Provide insights into the performance of the recommendation engine. Showcase examples of user interactions and the corresponding recommendations provided.

## Frontend
The frontend of the Fashion Recommendation Engine is built using Vue.js. It provides an intuitive interface for users to input their preferences and receive fashion recommendations. Instructions for setting up and running the frontend can be found in the `frontend` directory.

## Future Improvements
Highlight potential areas for improvement and expansion of the recommendation engine, such as incorporating user feedback, enhancing the training pipeline, or adding more features to the frontend.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve this recommendation engine, please follow the standard GitHub workflow: fork, create a branch, commit changes, and create a pull request.
