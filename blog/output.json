The new location currently has Chanel Classic Flap handbags available for $1,999 (regularly sold for anywhere from $1,795 to $2.495). Not a fan of Chanel? How about an LV or Burberry tote? I know, we couldn\u2019t believe it ourselves. The deal seems too good to be true, we\u2019re actually thinking of commissioning someone to grab us Chanel\u2019s before they sell out! What do you think of luxury goods sold at the same venue where you can get your groceries? We say, luxury for less? We like. *Image courtesy of stylist.com .

There\u2019s a bit of controversy surrounding the cover pic where critics are saying the photo was overly photoshopped and does not reflect her current weight. Self Magazine is fighting back saying they treated the photo with the usual retouching they provide for every star.\u201d Now let\u2019s discuss. I wouldn\u2019t call this a \u2018scandal\u2019 like everyone else, more like a disappointment. I\u2019m appalled that a magazine entitled SELF would literally erase parts of a person\u2019s body in order to make her to look \u2018better\u2019 in their eyes and, in return, sell more issues. I would actually feel more compelled to buy the magazine, seeing Kelly in her actual figure since it resembles a confident woman. Listen, we feel like everyone is ignoring what matters here. The girl is healthy. She is not morbidly obese. She is a talented, empowering female who loves her curves. Self magazine, we\u2019re disappointed.

Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not questioning them anymore\u2026 I am officially IN LOVE with Boyfriend Jeans! How you may ask? Well it\u2019s an interesting story. Yesterday I spent the day cleaning up my bedroom which was suffering from a major case of clothing explosion generated by me and my husband\u2019s inability to take two steps towards our closet and hang up our clothes! So I happened to stumble upon a pair of my hubby\u2019s jeans during this process and something possessed me to try them on. Well I did, then added a stretchy belt with a buckle made of two snakes intertwined, tucked in a white tank, threw on a deep purple coccoon cardi, and slipped into some heels. The effect was amazing and the pants were soooooooo comfy (skinny jeans are so binding in comparison)! The only problem though was that his jeans were a bit too big so I decided that I needed a pair of my own and preferably made for women since men\u2019s pants look too drop crotch for my own comfort. It looks like I\u2019m getting the same Current Elliot pair that I so unsurely blogged about two months ago which I find pretty ironic.

        "December 15, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview She\u2019s taken black from basic to bold , and it\u2019s no wonder that females are flocking to their laptops for fashionable inspiration. Hailing from sunny O.C., California, Jaime has found fast fame amongst the blogosphere, which we can\u2019t help by crediting her beautiful face and heavenly closet snaps. It\u2019s all in the colors people (in her case one specific choice), and this 20 year old sure knows how to wear it. Check out what she had to say and then prance on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: When we say that we are \u2018hooked\u2019 to your blog, that\u2019s a mere understatement. We can\u2019t pinpoint the actual reason why, but think it\u2019s your allure and mysterious demeanor through photography and writing that keep us coming back. Do you subconsciously post in a particular style, or was the concept of your blog thought out beforehand? Jaime: Definitely subconsciously! All the pictures and clothes I wear that day depend on how I am feeling that certain day. Sometimes it\u2019s \u201cmoody\u201d and other times it\u2019s just fun and lively! The \u201cconcept\u201d of my blog was definitely not thought out beforehand. As a matter of fact, I was going to delete it after the first day because I was very hesitant about it. But I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t, after all the interest and love I have been receiving from all the sweet and lovely bloggers (like Chic Intuition!) I have encountered! Chic Intuition : Ok, so we know you\u2019re addicted to coffee. So spill (not literally!), how many cups a day? Jaime: Only one cup a day, actually! If it\u2019s black coffee, then I\u2019ll have one venti sized, and if it\u2019s a latte or Americano, then one grande sized with triple shots of espresso. That\u2019s nothing compared to my sister who drinks three venti sized cups of coffee a day! However, today I had coffee overload with two large mugs of black coffee and a grande soy latte! I\u2019m really antsy and energized as I\u2019m typing this. Chic Intuition: So Jaime Wears Black, but does she wear any other colors? Jaime: Besides black, I wear gray and a little bit of white. Other than that, I think I own like four clothes that are brown, navy blue, and green. I think that\u2019s about the only color I have in my closet. Oh and I have a confession, I wear pink and Hello Kitty pajamas to sleep! Chic Intuition: Thank you for introducing us to your personal style icon, Jang Yoon Ju . She\u2019s one of our new faves. What do you love about her? Jaime: I love that her style and clothes are very simple, yet chic and classy! I think her style epitomizes minimalism and she shows us that less is more! Other than that, I think she has this charm and attraction to her face and personality. Oh, and I absolutely love her smile and the way she smiles with her eyes. Chic Intuition: Annoying scenario: you\u2019re given $1000 to spend\u2026.at [enter your least fave/most boring shop name here] what do you do? Jaime : Hollister and/or Abercrombie. Oh goodness, this is torture because they don\u2019t have ANY black clothes. I\u2019ll probably just buy tons of their pajamas for my sisters and me! Chic Intuition: Your closet is heavenly. Any advice on how to achieve our \u2018dream closet\u2019? Jaime : Decorate your closet with any pictures or even words that are inspiring and encouraging to you! It could be pages from a magazine or even pictures of yourself, family, and friends. I started decorating my closet with my personal favorite pages from magazines to always remind myself to be inspired and creative in terms of clothes and style! It encourages me to always be stylish and to never get lazy when dressing up. Also, try to organize your clothes by type, like t-shirts on one section, dresses in another section, etc. so that it\u2019ll be easier for you to mix and match your whole outfit together. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical q time: How much black is too much? Jaime: You can never have too much black! *Images courtesy of jaimewearsblack.blogspot.com .

You can wear a white tee with stylish harem pants and you\u2019re ready to go, or you can place it under a blazer for an office chic look. There are so many different ways to wear tees, and the best part about them is they\u2019re A)cheap and B)summer friendly. Don\u2019t even get us started on embellished tees.

        "September 2, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview Her beauty isn\u2019t her only appeal. It\u2019s the quirky comments, lovely video posts, and constant updates of model searches vs college term papers that make her blog so interesting and addictive. Twenty-two year old Laurel from It\u2019s Her Factory isn\u2019t your normal chick from Nevada, as you can probably tell by now, and that\u2019s why we just had to interview her. Read on\u2026 Chic Intuition: Let\u2019s get the obvious question out of the way first. You\u2019re an aspiring model, currently finishing her college degree. What got you hooked on to the fashion world? Laurel: Well, I see the fashion as just another way of self expression \u2013 as clich\u00e9 as that sounds. The industry, (along with trend and design) is constantly changing. I like the idea of being part of that, in some small way and contributing your daily style to the larger world of fashion! Chic Intuition: Is your aspiration for a career in fashion what fueled the start of a blog? Laurel: Not really, I was interested in what all of these bloggers are doing to show the world what their idea of fashion is, what inspires them and keeps them going. Starting It\u2019s Her Factory has actually opened up my eyes to everything from modeling (crosses fingers!) to even the idea of a career in writing or technology. I think a blog can really help a person to figure out their interests and just learn more from each other. Chic Intuition: Ok scenario: you have an unlimited budget to purchase just ONE accessory. What would it be and why? Laurel: Oh dear god, I would freak if I was really given this question. So hard to decide! I would probably go with an Yves Saint Laurent Downtown Tote in black leather. Simple and timeless. Or maybe a Givenchy? Gah! My head hurts, next! Chic Intuition: How would you define your style? Is it constant or do you rotate with the trends of the season? Laurel: It tends to remain pretty constant, but when fall comes around I do get more into \u2018chunky\u2019 mode \u2013 boots, knits, coats & scarves. My wardrobe also gets a bit darker with the seasons\u2019 turn, I love shades over color for fall/winter. Chic Intuition: Which designer are you currently digging? Laurel: Adoring designs coming out of Denmark like Ivan Grundhal, and Bruuns Bazaar. I\u2019ve got a thing for \u2018darker\u2019 designing like Rad Hourani and Martin Margiela, too. Such great textures and structure you don\u2019t get to see everyday. Chic Intuition: Agyness Deyn: overrated or underappreciated? Laurel: Overrated by a longshot. I think she is a phenomenal model, but she has been in the mainstream spotlight for WAY too long now. Chic Intuition: Philosophical question time: How long is too long? Laurel: Calf-length and Aggy\u2019s career. *Images courtesy of itslasfactory.blogspot.com and cmiper.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",
        "December 29, 2008 | Tags: Chic Tips Is it me or do the models in the Catherine Malandrino Spring 2009 show look like they have cinnamon buns pinned to the front of their heads? Do I hate it? Hmmm not really. It\u2019s hard to dislike anything with clothing that beautiful in the picture. Check out the chain detailed top in the middle especially- WOWZA! Anyways back on track, would you wear this look??? I can only imagine the amount of ridicule you\u2019d get from you\u2019re not too fashion conscious friends (everyone has at least one of those) but if you\u2019re willing to take the risk\u2026 To get the look: 1. Straighten hair with a flatiron and apply a gloss serum. 2. Bring all hair to the front and form a ponytail similar to a uniqorn\u2019s horn. 3. Split this ponytail into two halves and twist each half into a bun, pin, and you\u2019re done. Make sure and try to form an S-shape with the two buns. *Images courtesy of style.com .

        "April 14, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview Who could resist not clicking through a site with a name so scrumptious? The moment we started reading Emily\u2019s blog, we knew we were hooked. Cupcakes and Cashmere ( sigh ) is like reading the cool/stylish girl\u2019s diary, only better. This 25 year old Los Angeles native works as an online account manager by day, and runs one of the most awesome fashion blogs by night. Take a look at what this chic stylista had to say and then head on over to her world . Chic Intuition: If you HAD to choose, what would you prefer, cupcakes or cashmere? Emily: If I had to choose between cupcakes or cashmere, I\u2019d go with the cashmere (though a red velvet cupcake from La Provence bakery in Beverly Hills is quite a close second), especially in the form of lounge clothes. When I was in college (and very short on cash), my mom surprised me with a pair of Juicy Couture cashmere pants and they were an absolutely dream to slip into. Unfortunately, I wore them to the point where they had a massive hole in the crotch and I simply had to toss them. Chic Intuition: We noticed that you have a number of handmade jewelry that you make yourself, and we love the fact that they\u2019re made with unexpected materials. Where do you find the time and talent for your chic creations? Emily: Thank you! I\u2019ve always loved jewelry and I think working with slightly unexpected fabrics and stones make for the most interesting pieces. I\u2019m about to open up my Etsy shop where I\u2019ll be selling things like tulle and druzy agate necklaces and I think they\u2019re really different than what you would find in just your normal boutique. It\u2019s a great creative outlet for me as well so when I\u2019m watching a movie it\u2019s nice to simultaneously be productive. Chic Intuition: We know how unhealthy (on the wallet) shopping can sometimes be. But if there were a battle between internet shopping and actual store hopping, who would win in your case and why? Emily: There\u2019s nothing better than strolling through a boutique, thumbing through clothes and spotting a piece that was made for you. Over the years though, I\u2019ve become quite the pro at not only finding great things online, but tracking down the best price as well. With sites like Gilt Groupe , ShopItToMe and ShopStyle , it\u2019s easy to find exactly what you want at a price that doesn\u2019t hurt your wallet too much. Chic Intuition: So OMG moment while reading your blog: you were on an episode of THE HILLS?! Spill.details.ASAP. Emily: Ha yes, I was actually on several episodes of The Hills when I worked at Teen Vogue. I landed a job as a sales assistant with the magazine right after I graduated from college and a few months later, the MTV camera crew pretty much took over the office. The girls (L.C. and Whitney) were always sweet and it was just a fun experience watching the ways in which it was filmed and then getting to see myself on T.V. Chic Intuition: Name 3 Spring trends you\u2019re just craving to try. Emily: For spring, I want to try and mix patterns within an outfit. I\u2019ve always been a bit skeptical about pairing stripes with florals, but I certainly applaud those who can pull it off. I\u2019m pretty boring when it comes to my hair styles, but I\u2019m also anxious to try out things like multiple braids and hippie-inspired headwear. The last thing I love for spring is neon. Essie has a new nail polish collection coming out with pinks that you just want to eat right up. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how sweet is too sweet? Emily: Sweet things should always be balanced out properly. Whether that\u2019s a light pink dress or a cupcake, you never want to go over the top. So as long as you\u2019ve got a spiky belt or a cup of icy milk, you\u2019ll never cross that line. *Images courtesy of cupcakesandcashmere.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

MTV featured Erin hosting an intimate dinner party for 8 at her Tribeca apartment in celebration of her Fall 2009 Collection for her friends and muses who helped inspire the collection.

On the other hand, though, I can\u2019t help but feel that something about it looks off and a little costumey.

But in a few rare cases, some celebrities actually have quite a hand in the final outcome. The latest celeb line news to hit the web is that Whitney Port, of The Hills and The City fame, is being sued by a former employee who claims to have had a large partaking in Whitney Eve\u2019s design aesthetic. According to People.com , \u201cAdrienne Baravetto alleges she had an oral agreement with Port and her father, including a $80,000 yearly salary plus a 25 percent stake in the [Whitney Eve] company. Baravetto also alleges that she did virtually all the design work and that the Ports haven\u2019t paid her a dime. Port\u2019s lawyer Michael A. Taitelman tells PEOPLE, \u201cThe lawsuit that Adrienne Baravetto filed on March 19, 2010 against Whitney Eve, Inc., Whitney Port and others regarding the Whitney Eve clothing line is baseless and without merit. Whitney Port is, and always has been, the designer of Whitney Eve. Baravetto worked for Whitney Eve for a short period of time ending in early 2008.\u201d So who\u2019s side are you taking?

        "March 8, 2010 | Tags: Chic Poll One of the things we love about Nicole Richie\u2019s jewelry and fashion lines is that they aren\u2019t inspired or copied from other designer pieces but truly a unique expression of her taste. That is until now. We can\u2019t help but notice that these new House of Harlow sandals are a little bit too similar to the Dries van Notens that took the runways by a storm last summer. In her defense, though, we must say that we\u2019re glad she didn\u2019t go the way of some of her peers (ahem ahem Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton!) and knockoff the sandals completely but that they are maybe a little \u2018too inspired\u2019 for our taste.

What we love about vests is the fact that they\u2019re probably one of the most versatile pieces to have in a wardrobe. What we recommend for this specific vest, is to tone down the harshness of the black and metal with elements of, shall we say, girly-ness. Try pairing it with a floral dress, or for a more casual look you can go for a bohemian blouse and shorts. Finally, another way to wear it would be to follow Kim Kardashian\u2019s lead and go with J Brand\u2019s thrashed jeans , and a simple tank.

This used to be acceptable since Topshop\u2019s pricepoint was low, but we\u2019ve noticed a significant bump in their prices recently. On the other hand, we\u2019re huge fans of the \u2018Boutique\u2019 brand they carry, which is a bit more high end and worth your buck.

But now to my question- I am holding a birthday party with a masquerade ball theme (gotta love Gossip Girl) and I need a dress and a mask. I don\u2019t want to be predictable and I want to stand out. Got any ideas for looking chic under a budget?\u201d Oh, if only we had a penny for every time Gossip Girl influenced our lives, mostly our wardrobes, then we\u2019d be laughing all the way to the bank! So Leetal, since you\u2019re hosting the bash, obviously you\u2019ve got to have a look that no one else has thought of. One place we love shopping at is Etsy, since so many talented designers sell their one of a kind duds for unbelievable prices. Why not try purchasing a simple metallic dress , and pairing it with a ruffled bolero ? Add some beaded gloves , a and finally top it all off with an extravagant mask . Voila!

Inspired by Havana, Cuba, the collection includes cloche, fedora, sun-hat, bucket hat, newsboy and pillbox silhouettes using woven and printed fabrics with various embellishments. Her collaboration ranged from $15-$20, a huge difference from her usual $300 and up price range. We love Target! Can\u2019t wait to buy a few for our summer endeavors. *Images courtesy of target.com.

One of my fave shopping destinations has obviously been ( is this too cliche? ) Topshop. I know, I know, everyone raves and rumbles on about the high street store, but they literally are telling the truth. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, the store has some awful, cheap finds, but for the most part there are great alternatives to expensive trends. One of my personal choices in Topshop is their higher end Boutique label. I had to show you guys an item I would\u2019ve otherwise swiped my cursor over online, this Peplum Jacket . In reality, the fit is amazing, nipped right at the waist for a flattering form fitting jacket.

        "November 19, 2008 | Tags: Chic Find So sometimes, only when I\u2019m bored, I like to go back and revisit certain runway shows just to see if there were any details I missed the first time around. Well it happened recently with the Phillip Lim Spring 2009 show and let\u2019s just say I did notice an extra detail or two. This time what caught my attention was the cute side halo/bun do that all the models had going on. This style would be really cute when paired with an ethereal holiday dress. I\u2019m thinking something white and flowy and some very soft makeup. To get the look: 1. Flatiron hair to make it stick straight and add a shine serum to finish. 2. Split hair into two sections in order to make a side part. Make sure one section is significantly larger than the other. 3. Take the larger section of hair and twist and pin to make a slick side bun. 4. Now, take the remaining section of hair and wrap around the head along the nape of the neck and pin ends behind the bun to conceal and VOILA! A look fit for an angel. *Images courtesy of style.com .

Packed with celebrities, fashion\u2019s elite, and a live band in tow, the Nanette Lepore show was a blast.

        "March 23, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview We hold a special place in our hearts for our latest Chic Interviewee. Why you may ask? She not only shares similar interests in fashion, but our same heritage, which is quite rare in the blogosphere. Taghrid, a 21 year old residing in sunny LA, has gained a mass following for her unique approach to style. This \u2018chirping\u2019 girl, the meaning of her Arabic name , will surely fly far in her fashionable future. Take a look at what she had to say and then head on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: We\u2019ve gotta get the obvious question out of the way: So Taghrid, what got you into blogging? Taghrid: I have always been interested in fashion, but never really had an outlet to express my enthusiasm about it especially since neither my school nor work had anything to do with style or the fashion industry. After faithfully following many excellent blogs for a few months I decided to start one of my own. I guess I figured since I dress up everyday anyway, it would be fun and give me and excuse to obsess over shoes and clothes. Chic Intuition: There are tons of perks that come with one\u2019s recognition in the blogosphere. Please indulge on your top fave occurrences as a result of your site. Taghrid: My favorite \u201cperk\u201d is definitely being connected to all kinds of amazing people who I would have never crossed paths with otherwise. I\u2019m really appreciative of all the love and support that I have received through my blog through readers as well as professionals within the industry. Everything from meeting new friends to working with local designers and photographers has really been great. It really is a surprisingly positive and embracing community and I\u2019m just really thankful that I am able to participate in it. Chic Intuition: As a graphic artist, do you feel that your art transcends into your personal style and vice versa? Taghrid: Because my graphic design work is really customer based and I create products that are designed to fit their marketing and merchandising needs I am usually not afforded as much creative freedom as with my dressing. However, as with any craftsman, my work definitely has my personal stamp whether I am designing divot repair tools and bag tags for a country club or revamping a metal band\u2019s MySpace. Chic Intuition: What\u2019s your top dream purchase for Summer 09? Taghrid: I can\u2019t get Charles Anastase\u2019s SS09 runway platforms off my mind ! So so dreamy. Oh and since we\u2019re dreaming about summer must haves, a 1956 Porsche Speedster in candy red would be perfection. Chic Intuition: As Arabs ourselves, we were so giddy when we found a stylish girl from similar descent (so rare in the blogosphere!). Does your background affect the way you dress? We once remember spotting you in a Lebenese Debkeh vest, and thought your pairing it with a flowy dress was genious\u2026 Taghrid: I am proud of my heritage and culture and I definitely try to embrace it as much as possible. I grew up in Lebanon a place where style is greatly appreciated and revered. I accompanied my mother to chic lady lunches where I observed my mom, aunts, and their fabulous friends as they spoke of what they were cooking and had turkish coffee and Knaffeh in their classy custom tailored suits and dresses. Oh and I ADORE vintage Egyptian movies from the 50s and 60s where the wardrobes were as adorable as the love stories. A large part of my visual aesthetic is based in Lebanese ideals, I just put my own twist on it. Arabs in general don\u2019t get much credit for how fashionable we really are, I am happy to be a catalyst for changing that. Some of the world\u2019s most amazing designers are my homeboys! Chic Intuition: And finally philosophical question time: How frilly is too frilly?! Taghrid: When you border on looking like a giant Betsey-Johnson-birthday-cake, it\u2019s too frilly. *Images courtesy of taghrid.cc . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

You feel like it\u2019s a goldmine, and you\u2019re the only one allowed to prance around in it. But after a while, it gets a bit lonely, and dark, and you start to feel a tad bit guilty for not spreading the love. A few years back I found the motherload of designer brands online, and no it\u2019s not Net-a-Porter . I honesty l did not mention it to friends and family, and when they saw me carrying my new Balenciaga or those hot D&G shoes and inquired, I simply stated \u2018 Oh, I got them online \u2018. (Come on, give me some slack, at least I didn\u2019t lie!) I later felt ridiculous (and by later a I mean a few years) and finally broke. I started mentioning the website to my sisters, family and friends, and they instantly fell in love. Now, I am ready to tell YOU. It\u2019s an Italian website by the name of LUISAVIAROMA and it is divine . Need a hot, sold out everywhere else designer item off the runway? They\u2019ve probably got it. Click here and snoop around. Just don\u2019t be as greedy as me, and share it with those deserving. *Image courtesy of luisaviaroma.com.",

Ok, so maybe there are a few deviations here and there, but overall in shape, size and color the pairs are close. Same brand? Well\u2026kinda. They are both designed by Marc Jacobs, but one is under his high end line and the other is his diffusion (aka lower priced) line. Do we sense a glitch in the system? Or are we just that good at finding you anything you want at any price point? I don\u2019t know, you take your pick $98 or $295 ??? *Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

So does MTV think that if they create a snazzy word, viewers are actually going to like the show more? Umm, no. We\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt, and take that it\u2019s a typo (they probably meant sanctum: An inviolably private place ). We thought we wouldn\u2019t start off by judging the brief, and decided on giving the show a chance. We wish we had judged them. Bar Ravaeli is an amazing model, but an awkward host. It was really hard to follow her choppy sentences. Let. Us. Take. A. Look. At\u2026..you get where we\u2019re going. The ideas for the segments were great, but we felt like they were too many for a 20 minute show. Only part we liked was Erin Featherston\u2019s dinner party (more about that tomorrow). Sigh .

I\u2019d love a pair of cheetah patterened shades, but I\u2019ll pass on cheetah printed slacks. So to explain myself further, I love cheetah accessories . Yes, that sounds right.

        "March 11, 2009 | Tags: Real Life Chic , Uncategorized I know that this site revolves mainly around style, but what if we spot a stylish girl with a killer pad? We can\u2019t help but mention it, especially since I\u2019m an architect and dabble in interior design myself. Ever since the start of The City , I\u2019ve been eying the apartments of the stars and have to admit that each and everyone of them either has killer interior taste or some major mula that allows them the convenience of a fab Upper East Side Interior Decorator. Let\u2019s take a look at Exhibit A: Olivia Polermo\u2019s apartment. The secret to her stylish abode is credited towards her interior designer mother and the fact that her trust fund allows her the comfort of unlimited furniture selections; so the girl\u2019s basically working with two advantages. That point aside, we still think that with the right theme and attitude, anyone can create a similar space. Olivia\u2019s apartment has \u201ca 1960s look with a classic, old Hollywood feel\u201d, which we just adore. The fact that her space is retro, means that it\u2019s timeless and thus little Oli will never get bored in its vicinity. Just remember that shopping for furniture is not like shopping for clothes, a trick that Olivia\u2019s mom taught her, \u201cyou need to think of the look of the entire apartment.\u201d Touche! *Images courtesy of nypost.com .

Around two to three models actually met the runway face to face, while a few others managed to avoid the encounter by slipping and sliding around. The crowd was seen applauding when the models got up (double embarrassment). Personally, every time I see a model fall on the runway, I blush. I can\u2019t help but feel for these girls who have to manage balancing in sky high heels, while walking ferociously down an uncomfortably sleek and slippery runway with an audience of hundreds and cameras by the dozen.

Our next blogger, Aimee Song, is one we\u2019ve been following for a while. Turns out she reciprocates the love. What a small cyberworld we live in. Hailing from San Fran, this 23 year old is the definition of Beautiful Blogger. Read on for some fun and then pay her a visit . Chic Intuition: We just have to start off by stating that you are gorge! (that\u2019s Chic for gorgeous). What\u2019s your beauty regime? Aimee: Thank you! Because I have sensitive skin, I avoid putting too much make up on. I only draw my eyebrows and wear blush. When I go out, I\u2019ll put eyeliner on. I take showers daily at night and remove my make up with Aveeno Cleanser and after the shower dab on Lush\u2019s Dream Cream, which is all natural so it doesn\u2019t irritate my sensitive skin plus it keeps it very moisturized. If I every have dry spots, I\u2019ll dab on Aquaphor on my skin. Chic Intuition: You seem to have a lot of friends in the blogosphere. Did you meet after you started Song of Style, or did the clique form through a cyberspace connection? Aimee: I met all of my blog friends after I started Song of Style. It\u2019s amazing how many stylish bloggers that are actually really nice and friendly that live in San Francisco. Although I haven\u2019t become friends with every blogger I met, the ones that I did become friends with are so amazing that I\u2019ll probably have them for life. Chic Intuition: You have a jewelry collection that would cause envy in any stylish girl. What\u2019s your fave piece and why? Aimee: Most of my favorite pieces are ones I\u2019ve gotten from my grandmother. There is this one gold snake bracelet I used to wear everyday until I broke it, so now I have replaced it with a similar version of Kenneth Jay Lane\u2019s panther bracelet I found at the Fairfax Flea Market. My citizen watch which I have also gotten from my grandma is my other favorite. Chic Intuition: We have something in common, you study interior architecture, one of us at CI is an architect. What do you think the connection between architecture and fashion is? Aimee: Oh wow, that\u2019s amazing that one of u guys are an architect! Well, both in architecture and fashion, most of the time we try to create a comfortable yet inspiring experience for people. We deal with structure and shape and both architecture and fashion tell the social background of its inhabitants. I think I\u2019m noticing the connection a lot more nowadays especially in interior design and fashion as both deal with fabrics. Chic Intuition: Would you choose comfort over style or the opposite? Aimee: Both are very important for me. I probably sacrifice both to a certain extent. I\u2019ll never wear painful kitten heels in the hills of San Francisco but I do wear platform heels or wedges even if they aren\u2019t as comfortable as tennis shoes. However, no matter how lazy and sick I am, I will never wear sweatpants. There is a reason why Fashion Gods created leggings. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how designer is too designer? Aimee: Let\u2019s just say if you drive a car with Gucci logos all around the interior, umm that\u2019ll be too designer. *Images courtesy of songofstyle.blogspot.com .

        "August 9, 2009 | Tags: Chic Review I\u2019ve been meaning to write about my personal experience with my Babooshka asymmetrical tee, and my only excuse is that fashion took over my time. Remember the interview we did with the talented Francesca a while back? She so kindly rewarded us with a choice of any design, and I knew which one to choose instantaneously. The tee screams me, and I could imagine numerous outfit combos to dress is up or down. So you could only image how I excited I was once my package arrived. The tee was exactly what I expected and more. I loved the longer length in the back ( no need to worry about the junk in this trunk ), and it looked fab with a long chained necklace and skinnies. The only negative I could give was that after a wash, the fabric was affected (the seams ruffled a bit), but some might differ to say they love items that look like they\u2019ve been through some wear and tear. To those of you seeking an affordable fix, head on over to her boutique. I just did, and I\u2019m kinda eyeing her oversized box tee . Happy Shopping! *Image courtesy of etsy.com.

Your choice of wearing biker shorts is unique, and we\u2019d also recommend trying a pencil skirt underneath as well. Concerning what to wear with your lace skirt, the best part about this item is that you can either dress it up or down. Why not try a loose button down denim shirt for mornings out with a pair of sandals, and then take the look to the next level with a sequined blazer and pumps? Either way, we guarantee you\u2019ll look smashing. Good luck! *Images courtesy of shopbop.com and net-a-porter.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Her array of poses combined with ethereal photography and, of course, sensational outfits is what keeps us browsing Fashion Squad on a daily basis. Consider this interview a free styling session! Enjoy loves! Chic Intuition: Usually people get attracted to certain blogs based on the content, concept, or inspirational images. To be honest, (no matter how superficial this sounds) we were attracted to your beauty. Talk about model material! Do you ever think about modeling? Carolina: I\u2019m very flattered, but no. Modeling is not for me, I rather lurk around behind the scenes. Chic Intuition: I was discussing this with my co-editor the other day, I\u2019m actually contemplating a trip to Sweden based on the stylish senses of all the Swedish blogs!! Please tell me that not ALL of the Swedes dress this good. There has to be SOME fashion no nos, no? Carolina: People in Sweden are over all quite well dressed, but no worries, we do have a lot of fashion roadkills too! \ud83d\ude09 Chic Intuition: The photography used in your blog is just exquisite. It speaks all languages. Who takes the pictures for you, and what camera do they use? Carolina: Thank you very much! I actually take most of the pictures myself with a self-timer and I use a Canon eos 350d with a 17-55 mm lens from Tamron. Chic Intuition: What we gather from your writings is that you\u2019re a stylist. For those interested, can you brief us on a typical day on the job? Carolina: I work as a freelance stylist so I don\u2019t have a 9 to 5 job. Working as a stylist equals really long days, lot\u2019s of heavy stuff to carry around and being poorly paid, so you need to be really passionate about fashion. But you also get to meet lot\u2019s of inspiring people and I absolutely love my job. Chic Intuition: When did you finally nailed your personal style? Do you feel like it might evolve fashion-wise later on? Carolina: God yes, my style has been evolving since I was just a kid and it will probably keep on doing so for the rest of my life. Chic Intuition: If you were forced to live with just ONE accessory for the rest of your life, what would you choose and why? Carolina: My hat! perfect for bad hairdays or when I just want to be a little mystical, haha! Chic Intuition: Contemplation of the day: how baggy is too baggy? Carolina: A little baggy is ok, but when you trip and fall because of your baggy pants, it\u2019s a major sign that it\u2019s time to get a belt. *Images courtesy of fashionsquad.com .

        "August 12, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview We were extremely excited about interviewing this chic 28 year-old who hails from London but currently resides in NY. Karen\u2019s blog opened up tons of opportunities for her, like modeling in the latest Rachel by Rachel Roy collection. Awestruck? You should be, but just remember that anything fab can happen to you too. Oh, and we also had to know how she met the queen of the fashion world, Kate Lanphear! What do we love most about Karen? The fact that she admits to the urge of talking about fashion/shopping all day. Our kinda girl! Take a look at what she had to say and then head on over to her amazing blog . Chic Intuition: From your site we compiled the following facts: you\u2019re a model, you love fashion and anything DIY, and you\u2019re a blogger. So smart of us huh? We love how the focus of your blog is actually on what you\u2019re wearing, we sometimes tire of the personal therapy sessions other bloggers tend to drag on. What\u2019s your goal behind Where Did U Get That? Karen: I LOVE clothes and shopping. Always have. So I could talk about that all day long. I\u2019ve been doing so already for years with friends and anyone else who will listen long enough before their eyes glaze over. It was one of the reasons that I started a blog. I sometimes get asked where did I get something that I\u2019m wearing, plus people assumed that I worked in the fashion industry (I wish!), so I thought ok I really need to do SOMETHING. Hence the blog was born. There\u2019s no real goal for it except to just get better and better in terms of content and hopefully I would LOVE if it in some way helped me break into the fashion industry in some form or another. I\u2019ve had a really amazing time though in such a short period and have been given some amazing opportunities along the way, like modeling for the Rachel Rachel Roy new diffusion line now out at Macy\u2019s across the country. Chic Intuition: Congrats on finally getting your hands on the coveted Sam Edelman Zoe Boots ! On a scale from 1-10, how much do these babies up the outfit hotness factor in your mind? Karen: Hmmm. 1 \u2013 10? I\u2019d give them roughly 55? Seriously they are unreal. I strongly urge you to get your hands on a pair pronto. I waited years for these and am so glad that they got re-released. I almost fainted when I heard. The fashion gods had spoken. Chic Intuition: We had to take a breath when we spotted this pic of you and Kate Lanphear. Spill!! Karen: My stylist friend told me about a fashion industry party at the Soho Grand hotel and so I had to go. Neither of us expected to see Kate there, let alone actually speak to her!! She\u2019s one of my style icons. Effortless, timeless rock chick chic. My friend Tay Trong went up to her and just started chatting. I joined in and have to say she is so down to earth and very humbled. Zero attitude. Like someone I would actually hang out with had I not known who she was. It was so humid that evening though so beauty wise I felt like I looked like something the cat dragged in. Isn\u2019t it always that way? The day that you most needed to look your best for something unexpected, you look the exact opposite? Chic Intuition: What advice would you give any aspiring model? How do you crack into the industry? Karen: I was selected from Lucky Magazine (after they saw my blog), for a casting call for the Rachel Rachel Roy Fall/Winter 09 campaign and I was a crumpled mess of tears when I heard that I was one of the four girls chosen for their lookbook. I have never modeled professionally before (I am not signed with an agency but would love the opportunity. I\u2019m just too nervous to approach any ). The RRR experience really was my very first time. I have since done other modeling work for the designer which has also been a huge blessing. Chic Intuition: So we honestly think you are the ONLY person who can pull of snake printed skinnies. How\u2019d you have the guts to go there? Karen: I loved the print and the cut. Plus they were on clearance for $20! Bargain!! Plus anything relatively loud can be counter balanced with an over-sized plain top or a blazer. I have a rocker side to me so I knew I HAD to have those skinnies. The print on them is SICK. I think growing up in London all my life where street style is more experimental than in New York. I am not intimidated by wearing pieces that to others may seem a bit um\u2026 challenging? Chic Intuition: If you had to choose: hippie or rocker chic, and why? Karen: Wow. I love both but it\u2019s got to be rocker chic. It just resonates more with me. All the elements, the attitude, not just what is worn but HOW it\u2019s worn. Also the timelessness of it too. It just \u2018feels like me.\u2019 I\u2019m at my most comfortable when dressed that way. Hippie comes a close second though..! Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical q time: how studded is too studded? Karen: When it\u2019s worn on more than one piece at the same time. Can you imagine a studded bag with a studded jacket to match? OMG!! As long as it\u2019s one key studded piece worn all by itself and mixed in with the rest of your outfit, then it will always look cool.

Some pieces were hot, some were simply not. Although photos haven\u2019t yet been released, the wait for her Autumn/Winter line won\u2019t be that long: 9 days and counting. Till then we\u2019ll safely say: mark your calenders and see what awaits you. From the description below, sounds good. But don\u2019t worry, we promise we won\u2019t sugar-coat our review once the line hits stores and the web! *Image courtesy of topshop.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

        "March 5, 2010 | Tags: Celeb Chic , Street Chic For some reason, the street style shots of some of our favourite people (ahem ahem, Kate Lanphear) as they trek from NYFW to LFW to MFW and lastly to PFW have been quite rare. Why? No idea! We are sure she\u2019s attending the shows. Heck, we even met her at NYFW right before the Oscar de la Renta show! I honestly think it\u2019s the fact that designers are now inviting Tommy Ton, Scott Schuman, and Garance to attend the shows and sit first row giving them less time to take pictures of the attendees on their way out! Please, let the street photogs do their jobs people! We\u2019re dying here! Of the rare shots of Kate Lamphear, these two were my ultimate favourite. Just because each look embodies a totally different persona. On the left we see the soft side of Lanphear in her fuzzy hooded sweater. On the right, we see the fierce side of Lanphear (nicknamed Lanphearce by yours truly) which we all know well and have come to love. Tell us, which one do you prefer, the lion or the lamb? *Images courtesy of elle.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

We can say from the first look that the collaboration stays true to the distinctive Marni style with polkadot prints, amazing necklaces, and flirty silhouettes.

I remember the first time I laid eyes on this bag, a lady was carrying at a dinner hosted by my great aunt, and I was in awe of its design. First off, I thought the pompous granny had actually stuffed her classic 2.55 Chanel into her Chanel shoulder bag! I kept wondering why in the world she did that (other than the fact that she might have either forgotten to remove a bag, or was being a show off). Hers was the beige+black combo, but after seeing Lindsay\u2019s black on black version, I actually like the bag. Now, before you get excited about \u20182 Chanels for $3500\u2019, the bag only gives the illusion of two bags in one. Like? *Images courtesy of popsugar.com , bagborrowsteal.com and justjared.com .

You can see Blair Waldorf donning one of her headbands in almost every episode. But we\u2019re not sure if that will be the case next season. Seems like Behr has chosen to take the dark route for her Fall collection, opting for chains, rhinestones, and studs (a style unknown to preppy lovin\u2019 Waldorf). We love a lot of the bands, but are kind of scared of the fashion faux pas some of them might cause amongst the clumsy of us. I don\u2019t even want to imagine bumping into someone with one of the more spiky headgear.

I wouldn\u2019t even dare to wear a dress during the day cuz of the hassle it would involve dressing the look up. Well this photo of Reese Witherspoon really proves that you can take a dress and tone it down to make it an appropriate day look. Notice how she pairs her dress with some low-heeled sandals, sunglasses, and a slouchy bag. Almost instantaneously, her outfit is transformed to day chic and can easily be reverted back to night chic with a hot pair of heels and maybe a black blazer. Double-duty CHICness?

Hold up, we here at Chic Intuition have actually seemed to find another solution, where you can lose the weight on your own time frame ( aka food poisoning ) and keep wearing your fave denim! How you may ask? Well we were browsing one of our fave blogs , remember Carolina who we interviewed a while back, we loved this image of her in these rockin\u2019 leather lined jeans, and a light bulb went off.

Both being avid fans of Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re and his signature motorcycle inspired bags, we wondered if Wang could keep Balenciaga in a place of fashion cult-like stardom. The collection shown on the runway was very reflective of Wang\u2019s style and his own signature line. With a black, white, and grey color palette, clean and simple silhouettes, and strategically placed cutouts, the new Balenciaga takes a more minimalistic approach that speaks volumes to a younger crowd. What we especially loved were the structured satchel bags and the out of the box footwear that enhanced the overall look of the ready to wear collection. Only time will tell if Alexander Wang is a good fit for Balenciaga but based on his first attempt, we think it will be a success! *Images courtesy of style.com .

Well the first time is basically to grasp the drama, events, and ogle Jay. And the second time around I love to just focus on the fashions. You really do notice much more the 2nd time around, like the fact that most of Whitney and Olivia\u2019s wardrobe is from DVF. Now my second, and even more plaguing declaration is that I\u2019ve started to copy a trend I\u2019ve caught Whitney doing: let\u2019s call it the adjacent rings trend. Episode after episode, I found that she loves to wear two rings on her left hand, but unlike most of us out there who\u2019d choose to adorn our index and ring fingers, she wears them on her index and middle finger. Ok, I think this is borderline stalker- ish , but I took the liberty of saving some frame shots for you ladies. I have to admit, once you try it, it\u2019s kind of addictive. Ok, phew, feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Maybe I should confess about finishing the rocky road choco chip cookies to my sisters?

Now although some of you are upset by the fact that we encourage you to get similar versions of high fashion items, we Chics have agreed that as long as it\u2019s backed by reputable brands we support it 100%. We\u2019ll never direct you to a place to get really good fake Guccis or Cuccis (lol), but we\u2019ll always encourage you to look for pieces that are influenced by top designers because it instantly makes them look more expensive. So when the choice is between $120 and $1295 for a pair of studded sandals that will probably be out the next season, we say go for the steal, enjoy them, and throw them away when the trend gets old because we all know how hard it is to throw away Guccis no matter how tired the trend right? *Images courtesy of style.com and their respective links.

        "August 9, 2008 | Tags: Celeb Chic , Chic Picks We here at Chic Intuition have had our fair share of bronzer mis-haps. Whether we\u2019d end up looking streaked and tweaked or oven-baked burnt, we\u2019ve finally been able to out a bad (or good) bronzer. For beginners, we\u2019d recommend dealing with the powdered type of shimmer. This enables you to highlight the areas of focus, and simultaneously darken your features as you go. Cream bronzers, on the other hand, are quite tricky to maneuver. Most people squeeze the cream on their hands, and apply with fingers or a brush. After a couple of sweeps, they\u2019ll notice that their hands have turned the color of an orange mirangue pie. Don\u2019t forget how sometimes creams can create lines and patches for those bronzer virgins out there! This post was inspired by this image of a flawless Leighton Meester. The fresh faced bronzed beauty clearly knows what works for her, and in this case it\u2019s shine and sheen. Since we don\u2019t know the level of of bronzer application expertise of our Chic Readers, we decided to start out easy with our top 5 powder picks: NARS Blush/Bronzer Duo Guerlain Terracota Bronzing Powder Lancome Star Bronzer Laura Mercier Mosaic Shimmer Block Cargo Beach Blush *Images courtesy of justjared.com and sephora.com.

So far I\u2019ve been quite successful and must say I\u2019m proud of myself. Anyways, while on this mission I happened to check out my local Zara and lo and behold I found the crystal studded Balmain-inspired sandals that no one on the blogosphere is currently able to get. Apparently Zara stopped making them due to a stern warning from Balmain (well that\u2019s the story going around in any case)! Well I\u2019m happy to say I scored the last two pairs they had but unfortunately when I got home they didn\u2019t fit my feet So I was thinking of returning them and then I thought why not help a hopeless fashionista or two out there who didn\u2019t happen to get their hands on their own pair? So here goes, I am selling two pairs of these sandals in a size 40 Eur, 9 USA, and 7 UK. They are both brand new and never worn and one even has a plastic protectant cover on the soles. I must say these babies are very high quality and the studding and crystal detail are not in any way flimsy. After looking up their pricing on Ebay ($450-$599), I\u2019ve listed them here for $350 and free shipping to anywhere in the U.S. (for international a flat rate of $35 with insurance will apply).

His latest presentation entitled Astaire Case or Obstacle Course , was based around feminizing 50s menswear elements. We honestly loved every single piece in this collection. From the color palette to the beautifully sewn light floral detailing, nothing went missing. To top it all off, were the amazing accessories ranging from oxfords to top hats. The extravagant designer took his collection a step ahead of what we\u2019ve grown so tired of seeing, grunge and filth.

Ladies, and gentlemen (you never know), for those of you out there that consider yourself to be artsy fartsy , well then here\u2019s your chance to prove it for the mere price of $1,300. The Fendi \u2018Paint-Your-Own\u2019 Baguette is basically a blank canvas that comes with a set of Ten Pantone Universe markers for you to go wild with. Personally I think the idea is great, but kind of nerve wrecking at the same time. One mistake, and you\u2019re stuck with a $1,300 bag that you won\u2019t want to carry. On the other hand, I think that they\u2019re taking the whole \u201cone of a kind\u201d concept to a whole other level, and I love that.

When I offered to throw the party it seemed like an easy feat since my house is already decorated with a Moroccan theme. Lo and behold it was quite a job picking out flowers, table settings, and trying to stay as close to the theme is possible. Even when it came time to building my own Moroccan style low table settings (using unopened banquet tables propped onto coffee tables mind you) I was resilient on making it work using books and what not to provide the much needed balance. All the efforts came to fruition as the party was a smashing success! Even my DIY vase project made with branches, crystals, petite lanterns, and sand was a hit and got a lot of compliments from my friends. Since we know you guys like to get a glimpse of our real chic lives from time to time, I decided to share some pics. Let me know what you think!",

Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love jewelry, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m always running late, so decisiveness is a luxury. That\u2019s why I decided to invest in a couple of gold+diamond bracelets that I don\u2019t have to take off. They literally live with me, and are comfortable enough to sleep in.

I was going to a wedding three weeks ago and I really wanted to wear a long-sleeved maxi dress to go with a vintagey look. Well, at the time, I couldn\u2019t find a single one that I liked and today I find one almost instantaneously while trying to recreate this hot look donned by Cate Blanchett. She was out celebrating the 50th anniversary for Vogue and damn she looked good! I tried to find a red hot dress but was unsuccessful and so I decided to go for the general chicness of her look with the T-Bags Drape Sleeve Long Dress , Michael Antonio Women\u2019s Sawyer Platform Sandals , and the Rachel Leigh Jewelry Cleo Teardrop Collar Necklace .

I\u2019m desperately in love with this McQ sweater Gwen Stefani wore on the October 2009 cover of Glamour, and I\u2019m dying for a more affordable version. I would be so appreciative of any ideas! \u201c Hi Callie! Thanks for the amazing compliments. The sweater is so FAB that we must applaud your choice. Our advice on this would be either to wait for the original McQ one to go on sale or you can opt for a similar look with this Pointelle Marilyn Tunic in a larger size than you usually wear to give it the same baggyness of the original. Either way, a hot pink oversized sweater is definitely a must-have for those drab winter days. *Image courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

We\u2019d recommend trying this look for a sweet change from the harsh winter makeup wear. Start off by generously applying Givenchy Prism Foundation to the face and neck area. With the tip of your ring finger, slowly smoothe Benefit Cosmetics Boi-ing Concealer under and around the eye area. With the same finger, dab on the foundation over your eyelid from crease to brow line. Use a round-tip eyeliner brush to sweep Bare Escentuals bareMinerals Liner Shadow along the upper and lower lashlines. Blend. Apply Givenchy Phenomen\u2019Eyes Mascara to upper and lower lashes. Repeat numerous times till lashes have reached required thickness. Dab on Tarte Natural Beauty Cheek Stain on to the apples of your cheeks. Finish off the look by swiping Benefit Cosmetics Benetint Lipbalm and then blotting with a tissue. Voila! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and sephora.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Chic Intuition: We love how the seasons in Melbourne, Australia happen almost at opposite times than the rest of the world. So when we\u2019re snuggling up for winter, you guys are prancing around in your summer clothes. Do you love/hate that? And does it affect your outfit choices? Ashleigh: It is a love-hate relationship. I see what everyone is wearing overseas in the Summer and I start getting inspired and excited about all the wonderful things to wear, but then Fall rolls around and I am completely envious of all the leather, fringing and grunge. I love the fact that I can prepare extra early from the inspiration that I get from all the other bloggers, runways and magazines, but I do hate it because I haven\u2019t found many bloggers in Australia that I can be inspired by for our seasons and relate to in style. I\u2019m really trying to drag out some warmer clothes for as long as possible, for example I just bought the American Apparel lame leggings and we\u2019re almost in Summer weather! Chic Intuition: You study media and communication. Any goals of heading into the fashion realm in the future with your degree? Ashleigh: My course at the moment is a three year course, I\u2019m almost one year down and I have been looking into doing a fashion course afterwards. I\u2019m just not sure where to look or what to do I would love to be a fashion journalist or a stylist. I really want to stay in the fashion realm in some way or another. Chic Intuition: What\u2019s your fave purchase and why? Ashleigh: It\u2019s such an overdone answer but my leather jacket. I don\u2019t even think twice about grabbing it! I think it comes everywhere with me. I bought it earlier this year and I seriously thank myself for buying it everytime I pull it out. It goes with everything! And it certainly toughens up the girlier elements of my wardrobe. Chic Intuition: Hermes Birkin or Chanel 2.55? Ashleigh: Chanel 2.55. I annoy the hell out of my boyfriend about this bag. I think it\u2019s perfectly classic, timeless and completely versatile. It\u2019s just an absolutely beautiful bag. Okay I think I\u2019ve gushed way too much. Chic Intuition: Your blog not only reflects your fashion choices, but you talk about some aspects of your personal life as well. When do you draw the line on what to talk about? Ashleigh: I really enjoy knowing something about the person I\u2019m reading about whether it be on blogs, in magazines or anything. I don\u2019t reveal a whole lot more than just day to day events, such as if I bought something new or what I did during the day. I think it\u2019s nice to be a little personal, it\u2019s more natural, I mean, it is a personal blog aswell as a fashion diary, and this way I don\u2019t appear like a clothes horse robot. Chic Intuition: If you could choose any piece from a designer this season, what would it be? Ashleigh: Well now that Australia is coming into Summer that\u2019s really tough because I would love to buy all the wonderfully warm clothes but that would be a waste for another season. I would really like to keep some rock and roll for Summer so I think I\u2019d have to go with Balmain\u2019s studded sandals. I\u2019d die for them. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical q: How ripped is too ripped? Ashleigh: Nothing can ever be too ripped. *Images courtesy of iamashleigh.blogspot.com .

        "July 19, 2011 | Tags: Uncategorized We have all had the experience of looking at a celebrity and trying to figure out just what it is that makes him or her look so good. Even what looks like a simple pair of jeans can often look better on a celebrity than it would on just anybody. A lot of this is simply star power, and the perceptions we have of celebrities as beautiful people; but one way to help yourself to look as attractive and stylish as the celebrities you admire is to invest in designer clothing. Acne is one example of a very popular and very stylish clothing brand that provides high-end version of basic clothing and styles. Having originated not all that long ago in Sweden, Acne has enjoyed a steady rise in recognition and respect in the world of fashion, and is reliable for producing attractive clothing options.

Just keep in mind, this version of the smokey eye should only be worn out at night, or else people might claim you have another type of eyes, raccoon! Start off by covering your whole eyelid with a pressed powder base in a color that matches your skin tone. With a large eyeshadow brush, swipe black eyeshadow over your whole eyelid. As you\u2019re applying, make sure to move the brush back and forth (see the pink lines on the eye graphic). Take a medium sized brush, and rotate black shadow within the inner corner of your eye. Allow your hand to move freely, and it\u2019s encouraged that your shadow not be limited to just your lid, but outside the crease as well. Using a tilted liner brush, swipe the shadow upwards and out at the outer corners of your eyes. Look in the mirror\u2026.wink, and go! *Images courtesy of latahvalley.org and justjared.com .

        "August 18, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview If you, like us, have been enamored with Catt Saddler and Debbie Matenopoulos\u2019 style on E!\u2019s Daily 10 from day one, meet the woman responsible. Not only is Monica Rose the brain behind this duo\u2019s amazing style, she\u2019s also the force who managed to single-handedly put Kim Kardashian on the map as a new fashion icon. While the internet is infested with wannabe stylist bloggeristas galore, Monica is an established stylist who decided to start her own blog. The result? A 24/7 stylist at your fingertips with one click of a mouse! Her site is a mix of cheap chic picks, inspirational fashion shoots, and breakdowns of her clients\u2019 outfits. One look and we were hooked and we\u2019re sure you will be too. Think of it this way, what better place to get fashion advice than from a celebrity-trusted source? Check out our interview with Monica Rose below then make sure to head on over to her website for your own personal style session. Chic Intuition: Let\u2019s get the most obvious question out of the way, for the aspiring stylists out there, tell us what it takes to break into the Hollywood Industry? Also, what is the difference between someone stylish and a Stylist? Monica: It\u2019s about being reliable, following through, staying committed \u2013 not only to your obligations but to your clients and maintaining positive relationships with showrooms, designers,tailors, etc. Also, appreciating the people behind the scenes who actually make everything I do style-wise possible is key! I think that the best way to break into the Hollywood side of this industry is to be well rounded, follow through, have patience and never give up! Being young and hungry really shows in your work and people take notice and will want use you all the time in this industry. I remember I would work 15 hours days straight and not complain once just do my job. I was not even getting paid anything but I knew it would pay off in the long run. Styling is no joke it\u2019s not all Glitz and Glamour like people think it is. In regard to the difference between someone stylish and a stylist is that a stylist is in tune with what their clients needs and they don\u2019t dress their clients like they would their own self. Yes, of course I have my influence when it comes to trends but as a stylist I have to remember that my clients have their own body types, and that it\u2019s most important to dress them in what makes them comfortable and feel fabulous. A stylish person knows their body to a T and takes risks with their own image which is awesome! I love seeing so many stylish people out and about. It inspires me! Chic Intuition: I have this little mind game I play with my mom. I count how many times she literally stops in her tracks every time E!\u2019s Daily 10 is on, and stares at the ladies\u2019 wardrobes. What do you think makes their style so appealing to women of all ages? Monica: Debbie and Catt are amazing to work with. They both have very different styles. My goal everyday is to make sure my talent feels great and confident in front of the camera! They love being fashion forward and are open to any new idea I may have. I think women can relate to Debbie and Catt\u2019s style because they own their look, I make sure the wardrobe I select works with their body types and nothing is forced! It all comes very naturally. Chic Intuition: In addition to your TV gig, you dress one of the red carpet\u2019s style mavens: Kim Kardashian. Is there a difference between styling for TV and for the red carpet? Monica: There is a big difference but they are equally challenging! TV is so different because there are camera rules and it is very challenging to work around them. Especially with moraying, making sure things read properly , etc. I recreate all the wardrobe to fit the ladies for the show which takes a lot of time pinning to make sure it fits perfect for television. Its more work than you would think. Also, I dress them for 5 shows a week plus field shoots so always having a full wardrobe is a major challenge. Kim is amazing to work with and she LOVES to take fashion risks! There is more on the line when it comes to red carpet events so it is challenging finding the perfect ensemble and easier because I don\u2019t have to worry about camera rules. There are other factors to tie into red carpet/event styling like making sure the outfit is functional, photographs well and that the hair and makeup is in sync with her look. It\u2019s a team effort! Chic Intuition: Because Celebs are very public figures, it\u2019s hard not to view what they wear as a reflection of their individual style. We, however, know that it takes a team to make them look that good. Have you ever had to transform a style dud into a style maven? Monica: I can say that there is no such thing as a style dud, just people who need direction as it is a challenge for most people to stick with what works for THEM! When I started working with my client Khloe Kardashian, we literally went through her closet and got rid of SO many things! She was freaking out! It was time for a change. She had great clothes but she was shopping for what she liked and not what was right for her. So now she has a sexy, sleek style with very simple but definitive direction. And I think she looks fab and really made her style her own! I live for makeovers! It\u2019s my thing. Chic Intuition: Do you think stylists don\u2019t get enough credit for the work they do? Monica: I never really think about feeling credited or being recognized. I\u2019m happy with a simple thank you or a smile on my clients face when we find the perfect outfit. I don\u2019t need validation because I am happy with my work. Just looking back on where I was 5 years ago and the challenges I faced that got me where I am now is all the credit I need! Chic Intuition: Leggings, throw them in the trash or keep them in your stash? Monica: Keep them! I love leggings, they are so easy and effortless when done right. Chic Intuition: Truth be told, a ton of girls aim at investing in a Hermes Birkin. Do you think that should be the goal of a 20 something, or should she aim at something more accessable like a quilted Chanel? Monica: I don\u2019t believe in going outside your means for any piece, so I would recommend working with your budget. If you can afford the Hermes Birkin then go for it! It\u2019s a classic! I would personally go for the Chanel in a basic color so it will work with your wardrobe. Chic Intuition: Your blog is absolutely amazing. We love the fact that you always post stylish bargains. What are your favorite stores for hot bargain shopping? Monica: I love H&M, Topshop and Zara. I am also into thrifting and I get a lot of inspiration from vintage pieces. I love going downtown to the Fashion District. I find a lot of great affordable pieces down there too. I have my hidden spots! Chic Intuition: You\u2019re standing in front of your closet, scouring through the hangers and can\u2019t find anything to wear (been there, done that, huh?). What would be the easiest/safest thing to wear for a dinner out with friends? Monica: If all else fails I always fall back on my favorite skinny jeans, a great tank top and a pair of flat sandals. If the girls decide to make it a night out, I put on a pair of heels and a blazer and the transition from dinner to dancing is complete! It\u2019s always safe to bring a pair of heels out for those just in case situations. Chic Intuition: Since you are a stylist, we have to take advantage and ask, what are this season\u2019s top 5 style musts? Monica: I love this question! 1. Studs \u2013 boots, gloves, tights, jackets. Anything studded! 2. Gloves \u2013 Gloves are going to be HUGE this fall! 3. Animal print \u2013 HUGE for fall as well! 4. Structured pieces \u2013 Detailing, shoulder pads. Anything with shape. 5. Oversized or Exaggerated accessories \u2013 A MUST HAVE! Chic Intuition: We find it so intriguing that you decided to take to the internet and start your own blog. We must ask, what are three of your favorite fashion blogs? Monica: There are so many great ones! But I would have to say my top 3 sites I start my mornings with are fashionindie.com , becauseimaddicted.net , fashioncopious.typepad.com . Chic Intuition: Last, but not least, a philosophical question: how much black is too much black? Monica: Have you seen my blog! I always pull so much black wardrobe for my clients. I think black is very chic and it more slimming too. Every girl needs a black basic skirt, dress, pant and blazer in their closet. You can base your entire wardrobe for a week around those key pieces. There is no such thing as too much black! *Images courtesy of monicarosestylist.blogspot.com and flisted.com.

        "January 12, 2010 | Tags: Celeb Chic We love seeing new models down the runway, especially when they have quite a unique aesthetic. Lara Stone, born to a Dutch mother and an English father, was actually \u2018discovered\u2019 at the ripe age of 12. She signed onto Elite Model Agency at the age of 15, but her career didn\u2019t flourish until she switched to IMG in 2006. What we love about this girl is her chameleon affect. She can pull off any look, with full confidence and swagger. Fun fact? She\u2019s known for her wobbly runway walk, attributed not to her own talent, but the fact that she has quite small feet for her height (a size 7 in a size 9-10 world). In the February 2009 edition of Vogue Paris, which featured Stone on the cover and sole model in the magazine, she said she does not like the runway; that her unusually small feet for a person her size do not fit in shoes, and she often thinks, \u201cDo not fall, do not fall.\u201d Take a closer look at this gap toothed beauty who proves that different is special. *Images courtesy of style.com .

        "August 27, 2008 | Tags: Chic Picks , Chic Review Let\u2019s be honest, we all know that the Gap wasn\u2019t the destination you hurried to for a stylish fashion fix. It served as the better than bland place to shop for basics\u2026.that\u2019s about it. But now, we have to admit that with Patrick Robinson leading the design pack things have taken a turn for the better. Stores and their online shop are slowly releasing items from the Fall collection, and we are impressed. The fitted blazers, men\u2019s flannel shirts (bought myself a couple), and tasseled scarves utter Parisian chic sweet-nothings. Fall into the Gap? How about taking a plunge. *Images courtesy of gap.com and target.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

        "November 18, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview This time we decided to do something a little different. Instead of going the usual path of interviewing a fashion blogger, we decided to interview a blogger with a fashionable side to her. Ev\u00b4Yan Nasman hails from Pasadena, California, and unlike most bloggeristas, is married and to a hot vegetarian nonetheless! Apricot Tea is best described as Ev\u2019Yan\u2019s personal diary because she cover all things in her life, not just fashion, making her blog an interesting read. This girl has mad writing skills, if I do say so myself, and her blog is simply addictive. Check it out and prepare to be wrapped up in the world that is Apricot Tea\u2026 Chic Intuition: Okay let\u2019s start with the cliche question, what got you into blogging? Ev\u2019Yan: I actually started in 2002, when the term \u201cblog\u201d was pretty much nonexistent. My blog at the time wasn\u2019t very public, not very many people knew that I had one, and it was very anonymous. I closed it down directly after a horrendous breakup with an ex and never thought that I would make another one. But several years later, I had this urge to compose, and share, and have my own unique space on the internet. I talked to my boyfriend (now my husband) and asked him to create and design a blog for me. Within a few weeks, Apricot Tea was up and running. Chic Intuition: What we thought was unique about your blog is that, mixed in with the fashion, you also take reader questions and give them personal advice . What made you decide to do so? Ev\u2019Yan: Since starting Apricot Tea, I would get a lot of emails from readers randomly asking me for fashion & beauty advice. I found that so flattering and thought it would be great if I could have a blog dedicated to my readers & their questions, no matter how big or small. I soon discovered that there weren\u2019t many advice blogs around the blogosphere, and the ones that did exist, were run by an older generation. The best way to put it, I think, was that I wanted it to be an Ask Abby for 20-somethings. Ask Apricot is still flourishing in its own way, & it doesn\u2019t have the amount of success that Apricot Tea has. But I\u2019m proud of it, nonetheless. Chic Intuition: How would you describe your personal style? Ev\u2019Yan: My style is always evolving; it really depends on my mood. It can be light on some days and heavy on others (both literally and figuratively). I take inspiration from men\u2019s styles and the music I listen to. I don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s an accurate word for it. My style is just my own. No matter what I wear, though, I always dress for comfort. Always. Chic Intuition: One of the things that makes you stand out is your cute pixie cut. How did you get the courage to chop of your locks? And did your mom freak out (we know ours would\u2026)? Ev\u2019Yan: For the latter question: No\u2026 my mother did not freak out (haha!). She was actually quite proud, I think, that I was willing to cut off all my hair without remorse. At the time, my hair was shoulder length and I hated it. I felt like it was weighing me down, physically & emotionally. One day, I was looking at magazines to get inspiration, and I saw this black model with a funky mohawk, and I was like, \u201cThat is what I want.\u201d I remember taking the picture to my hairstylist (who was also my neighbor) and she was really, really hesitant to cut it that short. She kept asking me, \u201cAre you sure? Are you sure?\u201d And I was firm with my answer. That was about 5 years ago, and since then, I have never had my hair long. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll have a short crop all my life. It\u2019s so much easier to manage. My next version of a pixie cut will most likely be a buzzed head. I\u2019ve been wanting to do it for years. I\u2019m just waiting for the right moment! C hic Intuition: We noticed that you are married and to a super cute guy FYI. What did you wear on your wedding day? Did you go for the traditional or did you add a little of your unique edge? Ev\u2019yan: Since it was spontaneous (we eloped to Vegas), I didn\u2019t have a real wedding dress. But I did have a white sun-dress that I loved, so I wore that. Since it was in the middle of December (Christmas, to be exact!), I wore black skinny jeans with the dress. Jonathan, my husband, wore a white button-up shirt, with skinny black jeans, annd black Chucks. We looked very put together, but our personal styles still shown through. I guess it\u2019s safe to say that I added my own unique edge. Chic Intuition: Lastly, a philosophical question, how personal is too personal? Ev\u2019Yan: If you\u2019re a friend of mine, nothing is too personal. Nothing.",

Her 14 bag collection , inspired by her love of vintage, has a moderate price range of $43 to $323. We applaud her for being one of the few celebs which aim to please the mass market. But, unfortunately the low prices seem to unsurprisingly lead to a low quality collection. We haven\u2019t had the chance to see the bags up close, so we don\u2019t mean fabric/leather quality. We merely feel that the designs could have gone a more innovative way. We felt that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u201cbeen there done that\u201d when looking at the range. Take, for example, the logo of her line. It\u2019s a clover with hearts in the middle. Really? A clover Mischa? How unique of you. It really does stand out among Hedi Klum\u2019s clover for her jewelry line, or Muaawad\u2019s clover for their jewelry line, or Lucky Brand\u2019s clover logo, or marshmallow Lucky charms, or the millions of clover tattoos out there\u2026 When the logo seems uninviting, it seems to go downhill from there to us.

I\u2019ve been eying the blue version of the ones seen here on Dakota, and kinda wondering if I should go for the purchase. My sister thinks they are totally disgusting, and that I\u2019m too old to pull it off ( not I\u2019m not 45, don\u2019t go freaking out\u2026just 26! ) I have to admit that the black versions started to grow on me after seeing the whole look that Miss Fanning put together (pairing them with a chic blazer to ease up the edgy), but still too grunge for me.

        "October 26, 2009 | Tags: Chic Alert So a few days ago we informed you that the Olsens are collaborating with JC Penney on junior\u2019s line. Well the first looks are out and it\u2019s obvious that the line is directed towards teenagers. As opposed to their more refined fashion lines such as Elizabeth and James and The Row, this line has a younger more grungy feel. Honestly, I doubt I\u2019ll be donning any of the pieces personally but I still think it was a great idea for them to branch out like this. For those of you in New York, the line will be marketed in a very unique and fun way. An Olsenboye truck will be cruising around New York selling merchandise and giving out cupcakes, balloons and pins, and empty racks in 50 high-profile stores will be covered in Olsenboye shrouds.\u201d For three days only, if you catch the truck you\u2019ll be able to preview the whole collection, shop, and eat treats! Happy shopping!",
        "July 27, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview We\u2019ve been silently following our latest interviewee for some time now, and loved witnessing her online evolution. She exudes a bright, sunny presence taking after her hometown Miami, Florida. This 26 year old is a blogger, who we can safely say, has gotten chameleon style down pat. She can dress up like an elegant movie star, or dress down like a rocker girl. The unwavering factor in it all? Her love for fashion. Take a look at what she had to say to us, and then head on over to her lovely blog . Chic Intuition: We\u2019ve been following your blog for a while now, and noticed the evolution of your style. What triggers your outfit choices? Erika: Thank you. Being a fan of your website, that means a lot!! I change depending on mood and whatever I am immersing myself with from all around. I pull from everything that inspires me in someway. Celebrities play a large role, of course, as do model\u2019s style choices and preferences; but a lot of it also stems from music, movies and magazines that inspire me. Mood definitely plays a large role. Chic Intuition: We love seeing street style photos from different fashion capitals, there\u2019s a certain vibe that can be associated with each city. Do you feel that living in Miami influences your style? Erika: To be honest, no. All I see are tank tops, jeans/shorts and flip flops. I call it \u201cmessy beach bum wear without any flair.\u201d I like to pretend I live in another City or Country when I\u2019m getting dressed to go out (be it to dinner or to the grocery store.) Chic Intuition: On your blog you state that you \u201cbreathe and dream in fashion.\u201d Any future plans in the industry? Erika: I sure hope so!! Styling professionally is my ultimate dream, but I\u2019d also love to dabble in writing, fashion coverage from all over the World, if possible. Chic Intuition: You were featured on the Urban Outfitters Catalog (yay!). Do spill details! How was the experience for you? Erika: Exciting, I was contacted to model a few pieces for the blog and then they would later choose which one to showcase on their website. I was notified of being online on Urban Outfitters\u2019s homepage by many of my Facebook friends, shout outs to them!! Chic Intuition: So we can\u2019t ignore the fact that you own a pair of the greatly coveted Sam Edelman booties ( reminiscent of the Olsens\u2019 Balenciaga\u2019s ). No one could predict their online popularity. Do you have any idea how many fashionistas would kill for a pair? Erika: It all started when I first saw them gracing the Olsens\u2019 feet. Especially MK\u2019s. When I saw how easily they pulled an outfit together my heart couldn\u2019t stop beating for them. I enjoyed watching the many ways Mary-Kate incorporated them into just about any and every look (with mini dresses, skinny jeans and extra long t-shirts) were ( and still are ) my favorite. Then Rumi got them, only enticing me further. Now that I finally have them, I must admit the magic has yet to disappear, I just love them that much. ( thanks to Nicole for hooking me up! ) Chic Intuition: Talking about the Olsens, we think we\u2019ve finally found someone who\u2019s as obsessed with them as we are. What do you think their secret to style is? Erika: I think the truth is not overthinking it. They grab and they go. Always effortless yet pulled together, just enough. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that they have access to every single label I dream and covet to run my fingers over\u2026. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how stylish is too stylish? Erika: When you are wearing one designer head to toe and it\u2019s either too matchy-matchy or costumey. Mix high & low, that\u2019s the best; especially Vintage- my favorite. *Images courtesy of fashionchalet.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Let alone the fact that she has, well, perfect features in our minds, her fresh-faced fall makeup is the best photo you can follow. We already hinted at what products you need to invest in this winter, but to get her look here: Moisturize the face and neck area with Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer . With a large brush, evenly apply Bare Escentuals i.d bareMinerals Powder Foundation all over. Focus on the cheeks and temples for extra highlights. Afterwards, smoothly dab Benefit Boi-ing Concealer under and around the inner corner of the eyes. With a soft brush, apply Sephora Light Touch Highlighter from the lashline all the way up to the brow bone of the eyes. Don\u2019t over apply. With a small brush, line the upper and lower lashlines with Dior Impression Cuir Leather Couture eyeshadow. The key here is to be messy, and not focus on applying a straight, bold line. Finish off the eyes with generous coats of Givenchy Phenomenon Eyes Mascara . To achieve high volume without applying false eyelashes (as seen on Kim Kardashian), apply one coat of mascara, wait a bit, and apply the second. With a small brush, apply Cargo blu-ray Blush/Highlighter to the apples of the cheeks. Line your lips with Nars lipliner in Jungle Red . With a lipstick brush, apply Kat Von D Painted Love in Hellbent . Smile, and walk out the door! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and sephora.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

        "September 15, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview A little bit savvy, a little bit boho, and a little big gorgeous is how we\u2019d describe our latest interviewee. Meet 22 year old Kelly who hails from the Windy City. Her love for fashion and design has evolved into a blog that spills her hopes and fashion dreams. Keep your eye out for this hot designer, we sure are. Chic Intuition: We love hearing from fashionistas on how they started their blogs. Do spill please! Kelly: Well, anyone who knows me, knows I talk A LOT. My family and friends can all attest to having to listen to hours and hours of me talking about fashion, shopping, designers, etc. So I just decided to give them a break, but still have a release to talk about these things. I originally started chatting on fashion forums which is where I was introduced to the idea of starting a blog. Chic Intuition: Now, we noticed that you sew a lot of your own clothing, and they are just fab. Do you see fashion anywhere in your future? And in what amount? Kelly: Yes, of course, I love fashion and everything about it. I actually majored in fashion design in college. I would love to design for a fashion house, that would be simply amazing to me or even to create my own clothing line. I have even taken up wardrobe styling and am currently toying with the idea of adding Journalism to my major so I can possibly write articles for magazines. The jury\u2019s still out though. Chic Intuition: We sensed that you are quite the family girl. Do your mother or sisters have any influence on your style sense? Kelly: When I was younger my sisters influenced my style, but as I\u2019ve gotten older we have all just gravitated toward completely different styles of dressing. I still value their opinions but other than accessories our taste differs. Chic Intuition: Anything you regret donning? Kelly : Oh don\u2019t make me say it. I cringe at the idea of me wearing those off brand \u201cManolo Blahnik/Jenny From The Block\u201d boots. Yes I admit it, I was one of those girls to wear those boots and I loved them. But now as I look back I can\u2019t help but say, \u201cwhat was I thinking.\u201d Chic Intuition: Online shopping: addictive or annoying? Kelly: Are you kidding\u2026.addictive. Oh I am a slave to 3:00 a.m. online shopping. Shopbop.com , tobi.com , and eBay.com have all fallen prey to my late night shopping addictions. I think I need help. Chic Intuition: In your Gucci Fall 08 post , you managed to single-handedly transcend the runway looks into real life snapshots. How easy/hard for you is it to mirror fashion house trends? Kelly: I guess its relatively easy. As I view a runway I mentally go through which items I have in my closet that flows with that collection. But then again, I am like a packrat. I still have clothes from when I was 12, I know scary. But that makes it so much easier to find pieces that fit into a collection when I have a large variety to choose from. Chic Intuition: Scenario: your fave fashion house is closing down. What item of theirs would you scurry to save and why? Kelly: Hands down Balenciaga\u2019s harness boots from fall 06 and of course Chanel\u2019s original quilted clutch. Both had big impacts on the fashion world. Chanel\u2019s quilted handbag is always timeless. And of course Balenciaga\u2019s sculpted harness boots (both ankle and knee high version) are simply amazing to me. Chic Intuition : Finally, philosophical question time. How tight is too tight? Kelly: I always do a pinch test, if there isn\u2019t enough give in the fabric for a pinch then its too tight. *Images courtesy of alafemme.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

We felt it only necessary to freshen up our look, it\u2019s been a bit over 2 years since we first started this venture that we called Chic Intuition. When we decided to create a little blog based on the personal chats we had online, we never knew that it would grow to have hundreds of thousands of followers from all over the world. If someone would have told us a few years back that we would get invites to fashion week, guest blog for Glamour\u2019s fashion editor, and meet a whole new group of friends in the blogosphere, we would have voluntarily checked them into the psych ward. We owe all these opportunities to you, the readers. Without your support and kind words, Chic Intuition wouldn\u2019t be what it is today. Keep following, keep enjoying, and keep chic! We have tons of surprises in store for your guys, and we\u2019re just starting the style revolution\u2026",

Her posts are sweet, short, and damn hot (just like her!). Take a look at what this 31 year old girl hailing from Vienna has to say about everything from peeing in public to how hot her grandpa is. Loves it! Then head on over to Eszter\u2019s blog \u2026 Chic Intuition: The first thing we noticed about your blog, it\u2019s grunge-alicious! We love your take on rocker chic. How\u2019d your style evolve? Eszter: Thanks hun. There is so much inspiration around. I am constantly evolving. Hopefully forever! Also I am not the graceful type I guess. I kinda feel like a lipstick-tomboy who loves to get down and dirty and feels and behaves awkwardly from time to time. Altogether I feel more comfortable on the tough side. Yes. Chic Intuition: It takes a bit of guts and a lot of time to blog. What got you into the blogosphere? Eszter: I planned an online shop first, therefore the name and first posts. It was kinda a test. It still is. Hey, I still don\u2019t have a clue wtf I am doing. The blog is relatively new and I didn\u2019t think about a concept or so before. Its big fun and definitely the best thing about it is that you meet amazing people around the globe you would never get to meet otherwise. but also i feel awkward posting myself sometimes, you know? I don\u2019t take clothes or myself too seriously and I am shy and sometimes also pretty insecure. So it\u2019s a challenge too somehow. A fun one! And hell yeah, its a good cause to buy more shoes! Chic Intuition: What are your picks for top shopping destinations, online and off? Eszter : Must be definitely eBay , I buy nearly everything there! Also etsy.com , asos.com . For shoes: eBay ! And some skankaliciously good shoe retailers like VS , Bebe \u2026And when money is flat: gojane, urbanog. Others are the usual ones like H&M , AA , Zara , and a few national shops around town. Chic Intuition: Are those zipper leggings we caught you wearing? So dope! Did you make them yourself? Eszter: Oh no, mommy \u2018Hot Topic\u2019 made them for me. I suck at sewing big times. Chic Intuition: You seem to be fond of black, like our past interviewee Jaime. If you were told you could NEVER wear black again, what other color/s would you opt for? Eszter: Oh I love every color and wore all of them. The only color you will never see me in is light blue and maybe other pastels (except nude). I just don\u2019t feel good in them. Chic Intuition: We know your blog focuses on the fashion in your life, but how about some details about your personal life. Tell our reader 5 interesting facts about yourself. Eszter: I am extroverted-introverted. I guess the longest I\u2019ve gone without sleeping were 4 days. I like to pee in public places from time to time. I pretended once to be member of a sect to get a bed to sleep in. I am kinda convinced I will die in a tramway accident. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how bad is plaid?

My latest admiration goes to this amazing Valentino Red Bow-Back T-Shirt whose look and pricepoint really make a girl swoon.

She\u2019s been called one of the \u201ccoolest, most intimidating persons ever,\u201d and, judging from her frank demeanor and fashion world credibility, it\u2019s easy to see why. Cutrone balances running her wildly successful fashion PR company, People\u2019s Revolution, juggling Fashion Weeks in New York and London, with being a single mother and one of New York\u2019s most notable women about town. Personally some of my fave \u201cThe City\u201d moments always had Kelly involved. The lady knows how to make good reality TV.

Her perfected matte face and shimmery bronze eyes are coupled with a shy nude lip, and we know you all want to copy her! To get the look: With a wet sponge, apply YSL Matt Touch Foundation SPF 10 onto your face and neck. An important secret is to always apply foundation in upward motions; helps ward away future facial sagging! Then slowly rotate blush brush onto apples of the cheeks with Sephora Smashbox Blush. I love applying blush to my face as a first after foundation, this helps your face pop. With your fingertips, apply the lightest shade (Bouquet) on the Stila Eyeshadow Pan pallete all over your eyelids and browbone. Then smother your lids with the medium shade (Jezebel). Finally finish off inner and outer eye corners with the darkest brown shade (Espresso). Smudge Clinique Quickliner in Dark Chocolate on upper and lower lashes. It\u2019s ok to be messy, that\u2019s our fave part about the smoky eye! Look up, and generously apply Givenchy Phenom Eyes mascara to upper lashes. Finally, look in the mirror; SMILE and apply Vincent Longo Wet Pearl lipstick in Dahlila Fresh! Viola! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and sephora.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Help me decide!\u201d That\u2019s a great question Mary. We\u2019ve been wanting to discuss this subject for awhile on the site, but didn\u2019t know how to approach a sensitive matter ( sensitive in the sense that we\u2019d offend readers who had one too many piercings themselves! ). So, we decided that we\u2019d be honest and just give our personal opinion. Like we said, it\u2019s our own opinion, so you\u2019re free to disagree! Can you sense that we\u2019re begging for the hate comments to slide this time!? Back to what matters: We think that there should be a limit to the number of piercings a girl should get per ear. For us, the limit would be 3-4. Why may you ask? The ear is such a delicate feature, and just because you can\u2019t feel a whole lot of pain when inflicting it with a needle doesn\u2019t mean you should just go ahead and stab at it as you please. Note our choices for \u2018trashy\u2019 celebs who don the trend; they scream 1992, and not in a good way. On the other hand, we love how Rihanna and Hilary chose to just adorn their ears with a few pierces. We also love how they chose tiny earrings for their additional holes. We\u2019d avoid duplicating the same number on the other ear, the effect just cheapens the whole concept.

What\u2019s your take on nail art? Celebs seem to always find different, and sometimes cheesy, ways of adorning their nails, even sometimes stating their political views with a few swipes of polish (we\u2019re talking to you Eve). How necessary, and mature, is nail art? Is there a specific forum where it\u2019s appropriate to have little butterflies, stripes, and swooshes on your nails, or can you get away with pretty patterns in a business meeting with your boss? Personally, I think to each her own, and if you\u2019re a performer, have some fun with it.

Studs and mesh give items an edge. There are studded jeans, shorts and denim jackets with asymmetrical closures, short tuxedo jackets and matching shorts, dresses in a blue and white painterly fabric, a one-shoulder dress in a gray-and-black zigzag pattern with a thick black belt, and a T-shirt with the image of Moss.

        "July 14, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview This stunning French fashionista first gained recognition when the glorious Sartorialist aimed his lenses towards her. After a huge uproar from the style community, and many a request to start documenting her wear, Louise decided to start her blog Pandora . Chic Intuition: What encouraged you to start a blog? And what was your reaction to the great press in the blogosphere once your site was up? Louise: I got lots of encouragement from people I know who pushed me to make this blog. Plus, there was a great deal of remarkably positive feedback from the blog world, which made me very happy and determined to continue what I started. Chic Intuition: How would you categorize your style? Did it take long for you to develop a personal sense in fashion? Louise: I can\u2019t really define my style, it\u2019s a mix of the influences around me and all the styles that I witnessed and discovered when I was younger. All these helped me develop a personal style. Chic Intuition: We notice that the ratio of artwork to your outfit images is about 50/50. How influential is art in your day to day life (and style)? Louise: Very important, because I study art but I also have an intense passion for it. What\u2019s more, art inspires me on a daily basis, it shows in the way I decorate my studio or the in the way I dress. I love to draw inspiration from clothes (or an outfit) in a painting, not to copy the look down to the littlest detail but mostly to interpret or capture its essence. Chic Intuition: We just ADORE the glasses! Spill on where you got them please! Louise: They\u2019re Wayfarers from Ray-ban. Chic Intuition: Where do you do most of your shopping? And if you were to recommend the best places to shop in France, what would you say? Louise: With my student budget, I go to a lot of \u2018friperies\u2019 (thrift shops/second-hand stores).. I can\u2019t simply afford to buy designer goods. I love the thrift stores of the Marais quarter in Paris. They\u2019re not expensive and there\u2019s also the thrill of scoring an absolute treasure. If not, for shops of the better kind, you can find plenty of them in London\u2019s Brick Lane quarter. Chic Intuition: To this day, what do you honor as your best purchase? Louise: A stunning pair of Pierre Hardy court shoes. Chic Intuition: Since our personal French dictionary only consists of the words bonjour and bonsoir \ud83d\ude1b , what\u2019s your occupation? Anything to do with fashion? Louise: I\u2019m an art history student but I want to delve into fashion some time, particularly in the history of fashion. Chic Intuition: And finally, time for the philosophical question. How short is too short? Louise: It\u2019s way too short when someone tells you on the street you forgot your pants! *Images courtesy of misspandorapandora.blogspot.com and vonedar.blogspot.com .

        "July 1, 2010 | Tags: Chic Interview Seems like we\u2019re on a high for anything Aussie these days, so we decided to interview one half of Australian fashion label stylestalker . It\u2019s fresh, stylish, and most importantly-reasonably priced. The force behind the line? Two young friends, Rachel and Sue-Ann, self-confessed style addicts. \u201cWe were drawn together by our mutual addiction to \u2018stylestalking\u2019; scouring magazines, trawling the web and traveling to all parts of the world to devour all things style. We decided to create a label to satisfy our fashion cravings.\u201d Take a look at what Sue-Ann had to say below: Chic Intuition: Our love for Aussie designers is growing by the day. The amount of talent there is overwhelming. What got you into clothing design? Sue-Ann: My best friend Rachel and I were obsessed with clothes but couldn\u2019t find anything we wanted to wear which was within our price point. So we decided to create our own. I think that\u2019s why there is so much great designs coming out of Australia, cause you just need a great idea and anything is possible. Chic Intuition: Coming up with \u2018new\u2019 creations in fashion can sometime be quite an aggravating experience. Where do you two find inspiration when you reach a dry spell in design? Sue-Ann: We find blogs really inspiring. The way that girls put stuff together and add their own little touches the world of fashion blogs is pretty amazing our faves are zanita.com.au, fashiontoast.com, 4thandbleeker.com Chic Intuition: Please tell us about your latest collection. Sue-Ann: Our latest collection (will be on the website in July) is called \u201cwipeout\u201d and it is inspired by the fun surf beach culture of Australia. Lots of easy shapes, interesting dye\u2019s and killer LBD\u2019s Chic Intuition: Anything in store for the future of Style Stalker? Where do you see yourselves ten years from now? Sue-Ann: Not too sure, hopefully a shop somewhere fabulous\u2026 *Images courtesy of stylestalker.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

        "May 18, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview These days, it\u2019s rare to find an innovative, contemporary designer, but what\u2019s even more rare is finding one with an eco-friendly line that\u2019s also fashion savvy. Brigid Catiis is the product of a young Los Angeles based designer, who\u2019s obsessed with vintage clothing and accessories. \u201cIt felt good knowing that I was the only one that would be wearing my outfit- guaranteed.\u201d After college, she shopped regularly for vintage and soon began making re-creations from vintage clothing, each one uniquely distinct from the other. We got a look at the items up close and personal, and saying that we were blown away is an understatement . The 2nd best part about her 100% green line? The affordable prices. Read on to hear more from the designer and then head on over to her website . Wanna buy? Check out her pieces on revolveclothing . Chic Intuition: Let\u2019s start with the obvious question, what got you interested in fashion design? Raissa: One word: vintage! Having been an avid vintage shopper for almost 7 years now, vintage gave me a history of fashion. I realized that fashion never repeats itself, it just re-invents. It sparked a deep interest and now a love because fashion is a true expression of one\u2019s self. This was made evident through vintage shopping- clothes are expressive in any given era- no matter what! Chic Intuition: We think the idea behind your line is so current and interesting. What made you decide to go green by using renewed vintage fabrics for your pieces? Raissa: It\u2019s funny because I began doing vintage remakes so long ago just for the love of it and the actual realization that I was being the greenest of all green\u2019s came later! I first fell in love with the idea of creating pieces that were exclusive to the person wearing it- one of a kind-always! I knew the best way to do this was to use amazing fabrics that I would see on weirdly shaped dresses and skirts. After gaining momentum from selling to hundreds of women who loved the re-made designs, the light bulb finally went off in my head! I put two in two together and created Brigid Catiis in 2008. Chic Intuition: Do you feel that by not using any new resources you\u2019re creativity, in turn, is limited? Raissa: Yes and no. Yes because I don\u2019t have the luxury of creating necessarily whatever I want. I have to always take into consideration the fabrics that are available to me. However, this makes the design process so much more challenging and therefore, fulfilling. To take something old and breathe new life into the fabric to make a brand new piece takes every inch of creative energy from me, but when I see my ideas come to life from these recycled fabrics, it makes all the effort worth it. Let\u2019s put it this way, it feels like a Project Runway challenge every time I start designing! Like, how do I make brand new women\u2019s trousers from vintage garments? Chic Intuition: What we love about your pieces is that they have a flirty vintage-y feel to them. Do you think that the fabric you use keeps your piece in a relative era? Or do you completely take apart the old piece and revamp it into something more modern? Raissa: Each vintage garment is totally taken apart and made into something else. Most of the time, a dress, playsuit, and even a blouse require 2-3 vintage pieces to create 1 brand new piece. For example, for Spring \u201909, I used a lot of denim to make playsuits/rompers. 3-4 vintage denim wrap skirts are required to make one garment, so I have to make sure to buy vintage wrap skirts that are very, very similar in color so that 1 can be created. Yes, it\u2019s hard, time consuming and requires a lot of patience- but I love what I do! Chic Intuition: If you had to choose one favorite piece from your collection, what would it be and why? Raissa: I don\u2019t like this question. I\u2019m bias. I like everything! LOL! If I had to choose just one, which I can\u2019t, I would have to choose 2! Sorry! Rachel and Leah are both playsuits that are easy- easy in terms of not having to think too much to look cute. The pieces are also great for day to night events since it\u2019s casual enough for a bbq, but cute enough to be worn to a bar. I love the fit and how it emphasizes a woman\u2019s waist and both have side pockets. Enough said! Chic Intuition: Now, we have to ask, what line or fashion statement piece do you wish you had designed yourself? Also, just for fun, give us a piece you\u2019re glad you didn\u2019t design. Raissa: I have to give it up for American Apparel. They revolutionized basics and how fashionable it can be. We all own an American Apparel piece for very simple reasons- they\u2019re easy, they\u2019re comfy and they go with everything! American Apparel, in my opinion, catalyzed the t-shirt/tank/leggings/basics staple and they do an amazing job with it! Now, for the piece I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t design- Uggs. I just don\u2019t get it. I live in L.A. and still see girls wearing them in sunny California. Don\u2019t they make your feet sweat? Chic Intuition: Describe your personal style. What are your three style must-haves? Raissa: It\u2019s hard for me to describe my personal style. I don\u2019t necessary follow trends, but again, just stay true to my taste. I also wear lots of vintage. I would say 90% of what I have in my closet is vintage, so I mix that in with newer pieces. I can tell you that I hardly own any flats and save tennis shoes for the gym. My 3 style must haves are: Animal print: I have been obsessed with animal print since college and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over it. LBS: Lovely Black Shoes: Every woman should have a go to pair of black shoes that makes any outfit glamorous! Tuxedo jacket: My Brigid Catiis tuxedo jacket is with me everywhere I go. The tuxedo jacket can turn a jeans and a t-shirt outfit into an amazing jeans and t-shirt outfit! Chic Intuition: Lastly, a philosophical question, how green is to green? Raissa: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s such thing as being too green. With all the information we know now, in regards to the state of our planet, there\u2019s no restrictions on how green we should be.",

I recently bought a tulip skirt from Topshop and I\u2019m having doubts ever since my best friend blatantly told me that it\u2019s soo 80s and fug. I don\u2019t know why but I was attracted to it , unfortunately I don\u2019t know how to wear it, could you please help me out? \u201c Hey Shahd! Well it is an interesting choice but being that it has the brushstroke effect and a nice color palette, it can look hot if paired with the right pieces. First, I would wear it with all black to avoid color overload. I also took the liberty of choosing a few more pieces from Topshop to help you complete your look. All in all, if you really want to add a pop of color I would suggest a fun purple eyeshadow and maybe an oversized cocktail ring. Hope this helps! *Images courtesy of topshop.com .

        "June 1, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview At first glance, one might think that our latest interviewee must be an artist of some sort. On the contrary, 24 year old Diana is a marketing consultant with a flare for everything, well, fun! Don\u2019t get us wrong, she oh so amazingly dabbles in graphic design (check out her work below), but imagine how exciting it would be to go to work with such a colorful colleague. Loves it. Take a look at what this fab Jakarta native has to say and then head on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: Diana, we think that if anyone should have an outfit post blog, it should be you. We love how you manage to surprise us almost daily with your unique outfit combos. How much work does it take? Diana: Everyday is a new day to explore on fashion. I don\u2019t think it requires that much of effort and even cash, just our willingness to pause for a moment and try to figure out different ways on wearing the same clothes. Chic Intuition: Seems like you don\u2019t really follow the major trends, rather opting to create trends of your own. Why so? Diana: Trend for me is just a fresh breeze of what\u2019s new at the moment, not a rule that dictates us what is to wear and whatnot. It\u2019s hard for me to determine what\u2019s actually in or out or accept said guides from so-called fashionistas, because I basically enjoy fashion as art and art is very personal. Chic Intuition: Sometimes we find similarities between your style and Harajuku Japanese street style. Quirky colored leggings, mismatched top and pants, and over-sized accessories. We love! Who/what inspires you? Diana: Japanese street style serves as a very good example of how dressing up can be (and should be!) so fun, and I admire them for that! I am inspired by the Harajuku Japanese, in the sense that I try to have as high of confidence as they have. I\u2019m such a random person, and I often have so much random ideas..randomness is my inspiration \ud83d\ude00 Chic Intuition: In Indonesia, are people as accepting of your unique taste? Diana: Sometimes they are, sometimes they\u2019re not. I do often get confused stares, but you could always stare them back, right? ;p Chic Intuition: We\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019ve recently started dabbling in styling. Any future plans in such an occupation (even though you work in marketing\u2013please correct us if we\u2019re wrong). Diana: I\u2019d love to have a clothing line one day, but without the sacrifice of my main job in the corporate world. I love juggling between those two different worlds Chic Intuition: Finally philosophical question time, how colorful is too colorful?

A number of you have been avidly inquiring about Taylor Jacobson\u2019s watch that she has been wearing episode after episode. We scoured all the images we could find, and it\u2019s clear that she is wearing a personal fave: a Rolex Day-Date. Her specific model is actually vintage, since the Day-Date has gone under a mini makeover. We assume that Taylor\u2019s watch is the 1974 President Day-Date in 18k Yellow Gold . You can find the actual watch on bid websites like eBay, just beware knock-offs. Now, we know that Taylor Jacobson is a famous stylist who works for the glorious Rachel Zoe and probably has a paycheck that anyone dreams of. So for you frugal fashionistas out there, we scoured the web for some much less pricey options. Happy Shopping!

        "October 26, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview Its been a while since we last posted a Chic Interview, but we promise our latest interviewee is worth the wait. Currently running around between NY and Cali, this bohemian blogger oozes talent. Twenty-seven year old Krystal Simpson is the girl to keep your eye on. With a stint on an MTV reality tv show, collaborations with a t-shirt designer and fashion label, and a knack for writing that leads to full on blog stalking, Krystal proves that talent can take you places. Read what she had to say below and then check out her inspiring blog . Chic Intuition: I\u2019m going to start off by being quite honest about my first encounter with your blog. I stumbled upon a link in someone\u2019s sidebar, and was in awe of the photography, let alone the exquisite, and honest, expression of words. But while I was scanning your blog, I couldn\u2019t help but think \u201cThis girl looks damn familiar!?\u201d A little Googling later, I realized the girl from \u2018that Rolling Stone show on MTV\u2019 had undergone a fashion transformation. New haircut, new makeup, new Krystal. What influenced the change? Krystal: That\u2019s s flattering, thank you. But really, I change on a daily basis; I cut my hair all the time, and I\u2019ve always collected vintage clothing, and been into fashion. When I was on the show [I\u2019m From Rolling Stone], the focus was on writing, so they really didn\u2019t show my love for the fashion world all that much. As for the new makeup thing, it is really more like the little to no makeup thing. Women are so beautiful with no extras, they don\u2019t need all that camouflage to hide what they really look like every day. I just don\u2019t understand that standard in the fashion world, women and makeup makes no sense. I just know what we are naturally is so far away from our perceived image, fashion sense, and style. Were just wearing our preferences, we are what we choose to be every day, why not have fun and change it up, or not\u2013it\u2019s all up to the individual. Chic Intuition: I\u2019d like to think your blog is a form of artistic expression. How did you come up with the theme? Krystal: My favorite writing jobs have been the ones that allow me carte blanche, any time I have a restriction of any kind placed on my work, I tend to back away from it\u2013now thankfully I don\u2019t have to take those kinds of jobs at all. But I wanted my website to be a place to post anything and everything I could possibly dream up. The title \u201cWhat is Reality Anyway\u201d is double in meaning, both from my time on reality TV, but more-so from my love of quantum physics and the science of creating your own reality. I\u2019ve been a writer for a while, and my mentor, the poet and writer Maria Garcia Tabor always encouraged me to start a blog in addition to my various writing gigs. I should have listened to her and started one years ago, knowing now how blogging is the future of publishing, and all the opportunities I\u2019ve received just from having a blog. If I didn\u2019t start a blog would I still have a jean with Quiksilver? A t-shirt? I\u2019m quite thankful for all of it though, the dream continues. Chic Intuition: Music, music, and music. From the titles of your posts, one realizes how big a part it has in your life. Does it affect your style as well? Krystal: Oh yes, music was my first conscious style influence, the male rock stars specifically\u2013they are just the coolest dudes, full of swagger, and could care less what anyone thinks about them. Why would you want to be the groupie when you can be the rock star? I love the toughness their fashion, all the boots, leather, the beading\u2013those boys can wear women\u2019s clothes the way I love to see them worn, a little bit ragged. I like things in fashion to be a little off, disheveled. Anything too perfect makes me want to mess it up before I can go on. I never walk around looking like a too girly porcelain doll, it just isn\u2019t me to be cutesy like that. Teetering around on heels that really shouldn\u2019t be made for any sort of healthy foot, and piling on makeup, hair, all that extra crap makes me nervous. Chic Intuition: Let\u2019s not sidetrack here, how can we forget that you are a literary genius, prize winning poet and writer. What do words mean to you? Krystal: Words are great; so many different ones that mean the same thing, but they are all there to flow in prose, so beautiful that certain pieces can bring people to tears because of the way the writer captured a moment and expressed it. It really isn\u2019t the words, it is their perceived meaning that hooks us. Chic Intuition: So we have to ask, how did you get to be on MTV, and did the experience of starring in a reality show help launch your career? Krystal: Basically I sent my writing samples in for the casting process, and after a few interviews that was it. And yes, of course being on TV helped my career, although I never had any set career. People probably think I was just on a TV show and that was it, but I\u2019ve been writing for various papers and other publications since right after high school, and also done other things in fashion and photography. I never wanted to have real job, and I have done very well at not having one. I made a lot of great friends and business contacts when I did the TV show, and it opened a lot of doors. It was one of my dreams, to work for Rolling Stone, and the wave that followed it; going to Fashion Week, sitting front row at some shows, going to these crazy events. I mean, I am from a pretty small town, there is no grand events happening there, no fashion, nothing outside of the regular golf tournament, so I had always wanted to find out what else there was out there that was exciting and fresh. When I decided I wanted more, all my dreams came true in record time, I had to consciously conjure up new fantasies, since all the ones from my past came true. C hic Intuition: How does it feel to be immortalized on a t-shirt? Surreal? Krystal: The Ediot tee, I love her brand, it was so flattering, and of course surreal. I\u2019m glad someone thinks I warrant that kind of display, haha! Chic Intuition: Finally, philosophical q time: If you had to choose one, would your rock or would you roll? Krystal: Hmm , I could get really deep and philosophical on this one and say that like consciousness and energy, they {rock and roll} are inextricably combined, and one simply couldn\u2019t exist without the other. At least that\u2019s how it goes in my world. *Images courtesy of whatisrealityanyway.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

        "January 4, 2010 | Tags: Makeup Chic One of my fave makeup looks is the cat eye. The trend started a few years back, and hasn\u2019t budged off the fashion radar ever since. The great thing about cat eyes is that they compliment every eye shape, you just have to know how to carry out the liner. From red carpets to runways to real life, this look transcends perfectly in every situation. Take a look at our fave cat eye makeup and invest in a great liner to pull off the look yourself.

        "September 18, 2009 | Tags: Chic Review The thing we love about Etsy is that it\u2019s like a treasure chest full of undiscovered jewels. In this case the jewel we discovered (literally) is Michelle Chang Jewelry . She is a talented artist who actually makes the pieces herself and we must say that they are beautiful and suprisingly affordable. We had Michelle send over a few pieces for us to see in person and we definitely give it our quality seal of approval. Be prepared, though, that the pieces are quite delicate in size and that we would honestly go for the diamond pieces over the others. An added bonus? Michelle has so graciously offered our readers a discount for 15% off with the code: MCJ . Happy shopping people! P.S. Watch out for Michelle\u2019s stuff in a supersecret project we\u2019re currently working on. Oops! I think we may have said too much already\u2026",

        "December 18, 2008 | Tags: Real Life Chic I was invited to the opening of a friend\u2019s art exhibit, and wanted to look hot (who doesn\u2019t right?). Since I\u2019m growing out my bob, I decided to make a change and just bang it. I was so excited, I even contemplating taking the deed into my own hands. I mean, how hard can it be to cut off a measly few hairs in a horizontal line right? Wrong. I was on the brink of receiving a visit from my monthly friend, Miss P, and felt like I could do anything . Ladies, take my advice and don\u2019t make any rash decisions when you are PMSing. Hormones somtimes act like your best friend, or your worst enemy. I starting googling \u2018 celebrity bangs \u2018 and even created a whole folder dedicated to my fave finds. I didn\u2019t even know which image to choose, I just thought whatev, my hairdresser can pick whatever one she likes (or can pull off). That\u2019s when I accidentally found this hilarious article (which I now can\u2019t find for the love of God) that stated that if you\u2019re on your period, just off a breakup, or going through any sudden psychological manifestation, you should steer clear of wanting bangs . It also stated that there\u2019s much more drama involved with the upkeep of bangs than us bangless beauties can imagine (Scenario A: waking up with a cowlick on top of your forehead). I slowly started to think twice about my decision, and by the next morning I was so happy about not taking the plunge. So remember ladies, only make life altering decisions (aka cutting your bangs) when you are emotionally sober. But seriously do you still think I should get them? *Images courtesy of beauty.about.com, women-hairstyles.com, and coutureinthecity.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

        "May 17, 2010 | Tags: Chic Interview Our latest interviewee hails from ohsofaraway&fabulous Australia. Though twenty-one year old Dajana is a student, she can school anyone in the class of style. One look at her blog and you\u2019ll be hooked to her edgy coolness, we guarantee. This Fashion Styling student is sure to have quite an impressive career in the future, and we\u2019re willing to put our money on it. Take a look at our interview and then prance on over to her blog for more fun\u2026 Chic Intuition: Living in Australia, how does it feel having your seasons flipped with almost the rest of the world? Do you feel tired of the trends after seeing them online in other countries months before you get to wear them? Or does it work the other way around? Dajana: It does make me want winter when in Australia we are in the middle of summer and all I want to do is wear layers and all the new winter trends but in a way it\u2019s also good because I get to see what i will be wearing before hand, I get inspired so when winter arrives here I already know what I want to be wearing. Chic Intuition: Ok, so what\u2019s with the bowler hats? You sure can work them! Dajana: Haha, that\u2019s so weird you even ask that because I just got my first hat two weeks ago, I used to just borrow my brothers for some of the photos I took. I was never really a hat person at all but I\u2019m really liking it now! I don\u2019t think the hats I have been wearing are bowler though, bowler hats are more circle and smaller. Chic Intuition: Diet coke for breakfast? Please elaborate . Dajana: On that day I happened to grab a mini diet coke can from the fridge and I just ran out the door to do whatever, so when I was taking photos that day I had the can with me and it was visible in the photos so I thought I might add it to the post. But obviously you should eat something along with the diet coke people! Chic Intuition: Online shopping: annoying or awesome? Dajana: I love it. So addictive. There\u2019s just something about browsing online and then confirming your order and waiting patiently for the mail man every day. So much more exciting than going to the store. Who doesn\u2019t love receiving packages? Chic Intuition: For someone looking into starting a blog, what advice would you give them. Ours would be: don\u2019t underestimate the time/effort it takes to get a blog rolling. Dajana: I totally agree with your advice, it does take a lot of time and effort. People ask me this a lot actually and most people are just hurrying to get more followers, to get noticed, to get free things\u2026but seriously that shouldn\u2019t be your main reason for starting a blog. You can\u2019t get sucked into all that. Just start slow, post original content, things you love and want to share with others, there are so many blogs out today and everyone is posting the same photos, be different, stand out. Enjoy it! Chic Intuition: We have to admit that we have a huge obsession with Aussie designers. What kills us is they don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve. Why do you think that is? Dajana: You know I think these days they are getting a lot more recognition than what they used to get. Which is great. There are so many amazing Australian designers out there and they should be getting way more recognition but i think it\u2019s already happening. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time. How torn and worn is too torn and worn? Dajana: If it\u2019s falling apart at the seams and making you look like a homeless dude it\u2019s probably time to chuck it out. *Images courtesy of leflassh.com .

        "February 9, 2010 | Tags: Celeb Chic , Not Chic It\u2019s hard to believe that someone who can make leather look so good can also make it look that bad! Don\u2019t believe us? Check out exhibit A where Miss Olivia Palermo pairs a pair of leather leggings with a gorgeous military topper and an unexpected shoe pairing of grey booties. Now, head left towards exhibit B where she pairs some green leather shorts with a plaid top and black opaque tights and pumps. The result is absolutely shocking and definitely not in a good way. In any sense, one should proceed with caution when attempting the leather short by pairing it with a very feminine blouse in a complimenting color. A plaid shirt, however, takes the outfit to the country look you are trying to avoid in the first place! Not only that, but the fact that they\u2019re bright green???? Come on!

But now that you know we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll tune in tonight at 10/9c on BRAVO. Love her or hate her, Rachel Zoe is back and as always, she is bringing the fashion and the drama with her! Starting the star-studded season off with a photo shoot for A-lister Demi Moore, the team finds themselves having a lot of trouble keeping their act up when Taylor is let go. As expected, the next-in-line Brad is then promoted, but will be he able to handle his new responsibilities? And will the team be as strong without Taylor around? Woah, can anyone sense the bitterness? \u201cWhen Taylor is let go\u201d ?! We thought she stated that she quit? Ok, more of a reason to watch!",

I can literally go to the mall looking for clothes and end up with a new pairs of shoes. When it comes to designer shoes, I justify the price by looking for footwear that can only be described as a work of art. Enter these AMAZING YSLs! As soon as I spotted them in one of Tommy Ton\u2019s Fashion Week shots I knew it was love. Unfortunately, the exact Venice Leather Sculpted Wedges are only available in gold.

I would like to know what hairstyles are in style for the Fall and what hair colors are in as well.\u201d For Fall it\u2019s all about easy versatility. The most popular trends we spotted on the runways? Either pixie short or totally boho long. Hair was always tousled, so it seems like the \u2018out of bed\u2019 look is back. If you don\u2019t want to take the plunge with a shorter do, and you still haven\u2019t reached length-worthy locks, then try the high bun for some easy fun (especially if you\u2019re donning a scarf). As for color, we recommend toning it down to some darker roots appropriate for the cooler weather. Good luck ladies! *Images courtesy of style.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

I must say that I was absolutely thrilled that they fit me considering that I was about 18 when I bought them. The fact that I just had a baby may have turned the volume of happiness up a notch. With that feeling of overwhelming pride, I had a strong desire to wear them out of the house and am happy to say that I finally can. Flares are back baby and are expected to be the hit silhouette for the summer. I actually feel confident enough to deem them the \u2018new skinnies\u2019.

        "December 3, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview The daughter of an ex-fashion model and designer who gave it all up to raise her two girls, Jane Aldrige is living and breathing proof that sometimes fashion is just in your blood. A self-professed shoeaholic, and trust me when I say shoeaholic, Jane takes you into a fantasy world that all us fashionistas would kill to live in even just for a day. Between her and her mom, this girl has almost every IT shoe ever made and knows how to wear them with style. Being a shoe addict myself, I find Jane\u2019s blog Sea of Shoes extremely addictive and can\u2019t wait to see what she\u2019ll come up with next. Also, the rare cameos made by Jane\u2019s equally stylish and beautiful mom definitely makes for an added treat. Check out what Jane had to say about her love of shoes, her mother, and her eternal ramen noodle eating existence and prepare to fall in love\u2026 Chic Intuition: Let\u2019s start off by saying we love your style and your insanely amazing shoe collection. Being a shoe-aholic myself, I find it difficult to stop sometimes. How do you know when you\u2019ve reached your shoe-buying limit? Jane: Ramen for a week straight. Chic Intuition: How old were you when you started your love affair with shoes? Jane: I have to say that my love affair with shoes really started when I was old enough to wear them-I got my first pair of heels for my 15th birthday. But vintage cowboy boots were my first shoe obsession, that started when I was about 12. My grandma and grandpa run a business selling cowboy boots on eBay so they would always find awesome boots for me. Chic Intuition: What inspired you to start blogging about your footwear obsession? Jane: Blogs are a great way to connect with the fashion world-living in Small Town, TX thats something thats hard for me to do! I was definitely inspired by blogs like Style Bubble and Kingdom of Style-I never had thought of a blog as a creative outlet for my love of fashion. Chic Intuition: After reading that you were a junior in high school and seeing what you wore to one of your free dress days, we just have to know how your peers react to your outrageous outfits? Jane: I think I\u2019m regarded around school as an eccentric figure-people find my outfits entertaining, and I get lots of compliments about my shoes. When I wore a Comme des Garcons skirt over jeans my friends wanted me to take it off so they could try it on. Chic Intuition: From your blog, we were able to deduce that your mom was a former model/fashion designer. Obviously, fashion is in your blood and so we must ask \u2013 how has your mother\u2019s style influenced your own? Jane: My mom is the best shopping buddy. I am grateful to have been able to learn so much about the fashion industry from her-she also has an astounding knowledge of vintage clothing and is particularly skilled when it comes to scouring thrift stores and eBay for fabulous vintage designer pieces. My mom has fabulous style-this week she has been wearing vintage 501\u2019s everyday with random thriftstore jackets and crazy over-the-top shoes. Every day she has on a new combination of jacket and shoes-it\u2019s been very fun to watch the evolution of her intechangable wardrobe. Chic Intuition: Being known to be a little \u2018out there\u2019 with our fashion choices, we pale in comparison to you. How do you get over the nervousness of taking a risk with such bold fashion choices? Jane: Hahaha! I guess I never think too much about being \u201cout there\u201d-sometimes people tell me I look outrageous, and I\u2019m like, \u201cReally? Why?\u201d I see clothes as what they are: clothes! I can\u2019t really differentiate a pencil skirt and a tutu in terms of outrageouness. When you live in a happy little fashion bubble like I do, you don\u2019t think too much about how your outfits are percieved by other people. Chic Intuition: We are so sorry for making you choose (we know we\u2019d have a hard time with it ourselves) but who is your favourite fashion/shoe designer and why? Jane: Since you\u2019re making me choose I\u2019m going to have to break it down. Margiela for clothes-the most directional designer and Dries van Noten for shoes-consistently well designed and there is always a pair of Dries I lust for season after season. Dries is definitely my stand-by. Not to mention his are the most comfortable shoes. Chic Intuition: Do you plan to study something fashion related when you graduate from high school? Jane: Definitely! I can\u2019t wait to live a life consumed by fashion-it\u2019s what I love. I love it so much that it\u2019s hard for to narrow down what field of fashion I would like to be a part of\u2013but something along the lines of being an editor, stylist, or brand consultant might be the direction that I\u2019m heading. Chic Intuition: Where do you usually shop for shoes and what\u2019s the most you\u2019ve ever spent on one pair? Jane: Barney\u2019s is usually a good connect for a lot of my favorite designers-but sometimes I\u2019ll score good pairs on eBay or order from Browns Fashion. I\u2019m learning to be more resourceful when it comes to finding exactly the pair of shoes I want-I\u2019m squandering my first paycheck on my #1 pair of shoes for Spring 09. As for how much I\u2019ve spent on one pair-let\u2019s just say Ramen was [the] main food group in my household for a very long time. Chic Intuition: Lastly, a philosophical question, how high is too high? Jane: As high as you\u2019d like-without dislocating your hips that is.",

Thank you so much\u201d Ok, so we have to give you props for IDing the sunnies as not being Wayfarers, since they look quite similar to them. The fact that the frames are a bit larger and more rounded than the classic model of Ray Bans clued us into their brand.

Personally I\u2019ve been doing the pastel smokey eye for years and especially love it for those hot summer nights and paired with a tan. Easy to achieve is also a plus. Just choose any pastel shadow and apply generously around your upper and lower lashes and make sure to line your eyes with a black pencil and top it off with some black mascara. There you have it, a surefire way to update your look for spring! *Images courtesy of elle.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

However, we have previously been able to identify her purse and the sandals were a breeze. These babies are the Twelfth Street Luella Wedge in Black and judging by how many times I spot them around town daily, they are definitely the IT-shoe of the summer.

At 15, she is the founder and editor of her own fashion magazine with a recent viewership count of just under 130,000. In addition to seeing her cutting edge layouts and edgy designs in print, she has also had the honor to interview the likes of Rad Hourani. prim. is a publication which strives to showcase only the most cutting edge in fashion, music, and art and for her work, Kristin has been featured in French Glamour, Italian Elle, and Teen Vogue among others. On top of all that, she is absolutely beautiful and, in our humble opinion, mature well beyond her years. Check out our interview with Kristin below then head over to her amazing magazine here and prepare to be just as hooked on her as we are. Chic Intuition: Let\u2019s start by saying we are absolutely dumbfounded. After seeing your magazine we were extremely impressed and the fact that you\u2019re only 15 blew us away! What motivated you to start your own magazine at such a young age? And how did you get anyone to take you seriously? Kristin: I have always been driven by aesthetics; I am an absolute perfectionist when it comes to my image and how things look. For this reason, fashion and art began to consume my life. Instead of studying for math and science I found myself endlessly flipping through my abundant supply of fashion/art magazines. The idea to begin my own magazine came to me about a year and a half ago and I decided to run with it. It was a complete shot in the dark but it began to come together within a few months. At first no one took me seriously. I would tell people I ran a publication and their responses would be \u201cthat\u2019s nice\u201d or \u201caw, that\u2019s cute.\u201d I think as prim. began to really make its way around the web (and the print versions around the world) did people begin to realize I was absolutely taking it as seriously as anything. Chic Intuition: Do you spend most of your free time working? If so,ever long to drop the responsibility of running your own magazine to go out and party like other kids your age? Kristin: Well I think it is a misconception that I don\u2019t have time to be with my friends. I don\u2019t run the whole entire magazine myself; people write the articles, book the interviewees, find retailers, etc. I design the layouts and OK everything that is put on the pages. This does allow me to have a social life, which I do love. Sure sometimes I cannot go out because I am required to fulfill my responsibilities at prim., but it is actually pretty rare that I have to decline an invitation to do so. Chic Intuition: You attended your first fashion week this year. What was it like?Details please! Kristin: Attending NY Fashion Week was absolutely amazing! I got to sit front row at a number of shows and attend those which I never dreamt of ever seeing in person like Ports 1961 and Charlotte Ronson. At different points in the week I found myself sitting across from or next to the likes of Anna Wintour and Lindsay Lohan. I am pretty sure I attended around twenty shows throughout the week, but was unable to be there one full day because of a family obligation. It killed but I had to do it. Chic Intuition: Now to the fashion, we absolutely loved your latest issue! What was it like to score an interview with Rad Hourani? Kristin: Rad is an absolute genius; I was floored when he agreed to do an interview with prim. As a matter of fact I guess he liked the issue too because he invited us all to attend his fashion presentation for his diffusion line, Rad by Rad Hourani. It took place on the 28th here in NYC and it was amazing. You can check my blog for a first look at the collection. He truly is a master of his craft. Chic Intuition: Describe your personal style for our readers. Do you feel that you are now under pressure to always look good ever since you became an editor of a fashion magazine? Kristin: I definitely am a fusion of different styles, a little grunge and a little boho. I love studs, leather, lace, black, white, grays, etc. As a source recently described, a \u201cperfect fusion of Alice Dellal and Mary-Kate Olsen\u201d which I like very, very much. Being a magazine editor definitely did put a little pressure on the way I dressed, but not much really. I have always had to leave the house looking absolutely perfect so I don\u2019t feel the pressure as much. Chic Intuition: What are this season\u2019s top trends? Kristin: I definitely see a ton of harem pants, blazers, fringing, feathers, and pleats. I never follow trends; I don\u2019t walk into stores looking to buy what\u2019s \u201chot\u201d so I often find myself being lost in a world of trendiness. I am surely not an expert when it comes to trends. Chic Intuition: What\u2019s one trend that you think should be completely wiped off the face of the fashion world? Kristin: I hate neon. I saw a lot of it scattered here and there throughout various collections and I think the whole world would just do better without it simply because most people do not know how to wear it. I never wear neon; I don\u2019t enjoy bright colors much at all. Chic Intuition: With running a fashion magazine already under your belt, where do you see yourself 10 years from now? Kristin: Hopefully still at prim., only it being ten times the size it is now. Chic Intuition: Finally, philosophical question time. How prim. is too prim.? Kristin: prim. is definitely a fashion magazine with edge. prim. being too prim. would be trying too hard to look edgy either by overdoing studs, leather, repeating shapes, or patterns. No one likes a poser.",

We have to admit that our lazy selves , in addition to our hectic schedules, have pleasantly allowed us to constantly admire his work at the comfort of our own desks. He\u2019s young, talented, and into fashion; basically our kinda guy. Check out the interview below and then head on over to his blog . Chic Intuition: We find your artwork magnificent. The pieces are filled with emotion and utter beauty. When did you start sketching? Danny: Well\u2026 I\u2019ve always loved to draw and sketch. I got my first sketch book in fourth grade, but I never was any good. It wasn\u2019t until two and a half years ago, that I started to draw everyday and really work on getting good at it. Chic Intuition: Most of your work is based around fashion: models, fashion bloggers, designer ads. Any reason why? Danny: I like fashion a lot. I studied Fashion Design and that\u2019s how I ended up doing Fashion Illustration, so I think that\u2019s why Fashion is such a big part of my art. I draw models because they inspire me. I just started drawing fashion bloggers because I like fashion and as I click around fashion blogs, I would come across images that would inspire me or I would see images that just looked fun to draw. Almost all of the designer ads I draw or editorials are out of my character sketch book I started to practice drawing. Chic Intuition: How would you categorize your style? Danny: Not sure what I would categorize my style\u2026 to me, it\u2019s just the way I draw. No matter how much practice and how much I try to draw things right, it just comes out in \u201cmy style\u201d every time. Chic Intuition: What inspires you? Danny: Inspiration\u2026 wow. I would say just about everything. Music definitely inspires the mood of my drawing. I would have to say beautiful women are one of my biggest inspirations. They inspire me to try to capture there beauty on a piece of paper. Also, I love the 1920\u2019s and old pictures. I use all theses things to inspire an idea. Chic Intuition : Who would your dream portrait model be and why? Danny: Hmm\u2026 that is a good question\u2026. I would have to say Gemma Ward. There are a few reasons why, the first being that her facial feature have such an interesting look, so it always a great challenge trying to get the drawing right. The second reason, and I think the biggest reason, is she has an innocence and sincerity in her face and expressions that is one of the hardest things to capture with lines on a piece of paper, but on that rare occasion, if i can, it be comes poetry. Chic Intuition: We\u2019re sure we\u2019re going to get a lot of emails asking if you do commissioned work. Do spill if you do please!! Danny: Yes I do except offers to do portraits\u2026 but I do want to say I like to pick out the photo to draw. I have a pretty good pulse on what pictures would look cool in drawing form and what wouldn\u2019t. So I really like an assortment of pictures to look through and find one that just feels right. For pricing, it would vary depending on the size, and other specifications the Client or individual is looking for. Chic Intuition: We noticed that you use various mediums to draw/paint. What\u2019s your fave? Danny: Hmm\u2026. well that\u2019s a hard question cause my preference changes daily, haha, but I think my favorite which also is the one I feel most comfortable with is fine tip pens. That\u2019s what I use the most, even when I sketch and doodle. I like it because it forces me to put down confident lines with out the possibility of erasing. Chic Intuition: And finally the philosophical q: how sketchy is too sketchy? Danny: When something with a clear message is covered up by distraction, at that point it becomes too sketchy. *Images courtesy of igorandandre.blogspot.com .",
        "June 8, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview Here are Chic Intuition, are aim is to scour between hundreds of up and coming designers, and to highlight the best of the best for our readers. A lot of aspects come to mind when selecting which designers we\u2019d like to feature, but the two main elements that can make or break a potential interviewee are a) design innovation and b) reasonable price points. This next designer not only manages to fulfill our main requirements, but goes way and beyond. You\u2019ve probably already heard of her, since 31 year old Francesca has quite a following in the blogosphere. Her etsy shop, Babooshka Boutique , just oozes edgy chic. Take a look at what she said, and then head on over to her shop . Chic Intuition: Ok, so let\u2019s start with the obvious, what got you into fashion? Francesca: Since the day I could dress myself I always wore bizarre outfits. I always had a love for fashion and a serious shopping problem so I decided to change it into my career. I guess making it my career gave me more of an excuse to shop which in turn created the perfect anecdote for my poison. Went to design school and opened my first boutique immediately after I graduated. I knew I had to take a risk to get anywhere. Chic Intuition: How successful has Etsy been in launching your line? Would you recommend any fresh designers to create accounts there? Francecsa: My line was successful before etsy but once I closed my store I was sad that I would miss that interaction with the Babooskha customer. I continued to sell in boutiques but felt that with etsy I could have an outlet for that one on one interaction I crave. When I started posting my line on etsy last September I figured if anything it would be a place for me to test colors and designs to see their reaction from the general public but has since turned into a never ending queue of orders for people across the world. At this point I have shipped everywhere but Africa. Instead of being only sold in the US over 30% of my business is overseas. Chic Intuition: We love how a large influence in your collection are proportions. Your play with symmetry is genious and so \u2018in\u2019 these days. What inspired you to do so? Francesca : Since the first garment I designed I have never had a \u201cslight\u201d anything. I love drama and the trick it plays on the eye to pull off such volume while keeping the figure in mind. One of my first designs that I got to go \u201call out\u201d on in school was a 27 yard chiffon maxi skirt. It was amazing tons of shirring and volume. I think I play on volume so much because everything with me is exaggerated. I love to test how far I can push something while still keeping it sell-able to the Babooshka customer. Chic Intuition: What future plans do you have for Babooshka? Fracesca: Top secret!! All I can say is keep your eyes and ears peeled! Chic Intuition: Can you give our readers a glimpse into any pieces your designing for your next collection? Francesca: More exaggeration, more drape, more leather, more asymmetry, with a splash of color and tuxedo tails. Chic Intuition: Finally, philosophical question time: how asymmetrical is too asymmetrical?! Francesca: I don\u2019t think it is possible. As long as it is balanced out with the rest of the garment I am ready to push it as far as possible. Asymmetry and knits are the perfect marriage of two words to describe Babooshka\u2026 *Images courtesy of babooshkaboutique. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

First, we wanted to prove that you can take any look you admire in a magazine spread and make it your own ( very easily ). And second, you can achieve the look for much less. So without further ado, take a look at this 10 Magazine spread where the model is rocking Luella from head to toe. Cute right? Wanna know what\u2019s cuter? Our $160 version! We chose a similar character tee , ruffled floral mini and lace-up boots . Voila! Instant look for less. *Images courtesy of knighttcat.blogspot.com and their respective links.

We\u2019ll assume that you\u2019re an optimist and want to hear the good news first. We know where you can find her headband! Bad news? It\u2019s sold out online. So the actual band Whitney wears is by Anthropologie , it\u2019s called the Roaring Rose Headwrap $24 (style #844327). We recommend calling your local store and asking if they have one in stock. Now if it\u2019s nowhere to be found ( which you can probably credit Whitney\u2019s celebrity style influence ), than you can try this or this option by Free People.

        "May 24, 2010 | Tags: Chic Interview Our next interviewee is bad-ass without the attitude, edgy with a twist of girlish demure. Christine resides in LA ( doesn\u2019t it seem like all stylish bloggers do? ) but her loyal fans are from every corner of the globe. She has a degree in fashion, styles, designs, and recently launched her own brand! Talk about an impressive resume for this 25 year old. Check out what she had to say to Chic Intuition and then strut on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: You do a little styling and designing here and there. Talk about a dream job. How\u2019d you get into it? Chris: I studied at a 2 year fashion design school straight out of high school and got a design job right when I graduated. So at 20, I started my design career. Now that I\u2019m 25, I\u2019m venturing into focusing on my own brands such as UNIF (I run with with my boyfriend Eric) and PlayMe Jeans (I own with Eric and my friend Tom from Joyrich) Styling is something I absolutely love but isn\u2019t really my focus. I usually get referred to a job and am always down to do it! Chic Intuition: Seems like you love vintage/flee market shopping. What\u2019s your FAVE purchase to date? Chris: Ooo..that is going to be a tough decision since 75% of my wardrobe is vintage. I guess my most recent fave flea market purchase is a camo marijuana t-shirt I got last week at the Rose Bowl flea market! Chic Intuition: We have something in common: our obsession with the Wangster. We know what we love about him, but why don\u2019t you shower our readers with a little Top 5 Reasons I Heart Alexander? Chris: 1. He\u2019s young so his fresh take on simple designs comes so naturally and un-contrived. 2. Obviously, I love him because he is brutally talented in knowing what looks good. He\u2019s one of the few designers where I can look at the whole collection and \u201cget\u201d why he does each piece. He is so on point. 3. I appreciate his ability to make fashion forward items that are still basic enough to appeal to a wide audience. His stuff is so wearable and likable because he doesn\u2019t get too crazy and avant-garde. Sometimes designs get so overwhelming that it ends up not being wearable or affordable. 4. The ingenious ways he plays with texture\u2026like making leather look like denim or mixing french terry with mesh or corduroy with leather. The list goes on but I really do appreciate his play on textures. 5. He is SUPER nice and sweet when I met him once. Chic Intuition: What was the best thing to have happened to you as a result of blogging? Chris: The best thing to come out of the blog is me actually being motivated to document my interests/outfits/inspirations from this time in my life. Before the blog I was carelessly living without archiving/documenting anything and it got me scared that I would forget when I become an old lady!! Chic Intuition: Name 3 items you\u2019ve been eying as your next fashion purchases for summer. Chris: I\u2019ve been on a mad woman hunt for the perfect tan/nude platforms, a sheer nude over-sized button up, and a light weight sheer trench. Lots of sheer, I know! Chic Intuition: Tell us a little about Play Me Jeans. Chris: PlayMe Jeans is a bottoms brand I launched in Feb with Eric and friend Tom from Joyrich. We will be in stores July. Some online retailers will include Karmaloop , NastyGal , and Revolve Clothing . Check out the styles at: www.playmejeans.com ! Chic Intuition: How in the world do you get your hair to have that perfect beachy wave look?! Jealous! Chris: Lol\u2026I have a digital perm. Sounds weird and tech-y but apparently it\u2019s just a less abrasive way to get a wave perm. It makes my life so easy; my hair is a wash n\u2019 go situation! Chic Intuition: Philosophical question time: how many Wang bags are too many to own? Chris : As long as you like something and have the means to buy it, there should be no limit! If I could afford to, I would buy many more Wang bags! *Images courtesy of christeric.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",
        "August 9, 2008 | Tags: Not Chic I\u2019d like to take this opportunity (of having my own blog and all) to talk about a subject near and dear to my heart. A subject that, mind you, might offend the sensitive of the bunch (or those of you out there that follow this \u201ctrend\u201d). Before starting, the trick of the trade, as you might have recognized from the title of the post and the images, is the oh so weird combination of blow dried bangs and curly hair. I know that a lot of you will excuse this habit by stating that it minimizes frizz, or gives a nice frame to the face. False. I think that you either have to choose to go curly or straight all the way, from start to finish & from root to end. Why not go natural, and let the curls run wild? I guarantee it\u2019ll look much better than the 80s permed affect the half-half will give. Now I know the character of Pam Beesly from The Office is just playing the role of un -fashionista, rightfully displaying so in her hairstyle, but I didn\u2019t want to place an actual photo and offend anyone (yes, if you google \u201cperm\u201d believe me, you will find pages of offenders). So to answer the equation above straightened bangs+curly hair= disaster! On a side note, I\u2019m a huge fan of The Office, and this post is not aimed at dissing the show.

Yes people, I\u2019m talking about the latest Project Runway Finale Judge. Based on this new development, I predict that Korto will be the winner of this season. Why you may ask? I honestly believe that the winner of Project Runway is usually dependant on the personal style of the celebrity guest judge and I think Korto\u2019s design aesthetic is very Jlo-esque.

        "October 5, 2009 | Tags: Chic Review , Not Chic When we first heard that Lohan was appointed \u2018Creative Director\u2019 of Ungaro we were shocked to say the least. We know that actors and singers have smudged the line between entertainment and design (with numerous collaborations, both poor and gorge to support the aforementioned), but one of the most prestigious fashion houses hiring an actress with a track record of tardiness, drugs, alcohol, and pure drama seemed a bit reckless on Ungaro\u2019s part. Don\u2019t forget the fact that one of our personal faves, and youngest fashion talents out there, Esteban Cortazar coincidentally left the label as head designer when Lindsay\u2019s job was made public, only adding salt to our wounds. So you can imagine our anticipation for their Spring 2010 show, and we can happily say we were pleased that our initial predictions were correct. The designs were amateur and the glittery pasties were cheesy and we could instantly see the brand slip away from the cooler and more modern direction that Esteban was taking it in. Do we believe Lindsay actually had a huge part to do with it? Not really. Do we think she was hired to create buzz for the Emanuel Ungaro line? Yes most definitely. Do we still think she needs help and seems a bit off? Take a look at her talking in the video below and decide yourselves.",

        "May 3, 2010 | Tags: Chic Interview We met this fashionista at New York Fashion Week, and have to admit that standing beside her in line was quite astonishing. Liz Cherkasova is a blogger who hails from San Fransisco and also works for Chictopia , the online destination for anything style-worthy. She strikes you as someone who\u2019s face should be on banners everywhere, but her fragile voice is actually soothingly modest. She\u2019s the perfect Chic Interviewee since her blog oozes style and personal tidbits. Take a look at what she had to say to us and then head on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: When we met at NYFW, you blew us away with two things: your height and your style. Now, since height is something not everyone is voluntarily blessed with, how do you advise our readers on developing unique personal style? Liz: I think the most important aspect of developing a personal style is staying true to yourself. There are so many looks, trends and sources of inspiration out there, it\u2019s easy to loose yourself. Know what works for you, body wise and aesthtetic wise. Wear things you love and that make you feel confident. Confidence is style. Chic Intuition: We love your tips for flying in style. How about tips for styling those cool bangs you rock? Liz: Haha, I get this question a lot. I honestly don\u2019t style my bangs besides brushing them. Once in a while, if they get too crazy on me, I\u2019ll run a straighter through them. Chic Intuition: Nutella. We call it the best invention after Internet. Both are harmful if overdosed on, but oh so worth the addiction. If you had to chose one, what would it be? Liz: Food, I love food. All food. Chic Intuition: We love how you\u2019re a style chameleon. One day you can go from rocker chic, and the next you\u2019re rocking pink ruffles and lace. What do you base your looks on? Liz: My looks are based on my moods. Every day I wake up and feel a little different. I pick out pieces that appeal to me and let the looks come together naturally. I never force myself to wear something. It has to \u201cfeel\u201d right. Chic Intuition: You openly discuss your mother\u2019s illness on your blog. We can only imagine the out pour of support from your followers. When do you draw the line to featuring personal matters online? Liz: You know, this is a really great question. For a long time I struggled with how personal is too personal. I finally came to the realization that I run a personal style blog. I don\u2019t usually discuss too many personal aspects of my life, but something like my mother\u2019s illness is a huge part of it right now. Not talking about it would be like leaving a big part of myself out of my blog. I know that everyone can relate to having a sick loved one and so I felt like sharing this part of my life would be very relatable to my readers. Chic Intuition: Where are your fave stores to shop both in reality and virtually? Liz: I love h&m, ZARA as well as vintage and thrift stores. I am not a huge online shopper, simply because I really like to try things on, but if I shop online I tend to stick to ModCloth, NeedSupply, tobi.com and Nastygal (mostly because I know these companies well and can guess at the quality and fit of the clothing). I also love browsing etsy and ebay. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: How feminine is too feminine? Liz: Hmm \u2026 It all depends on your own personal taste, but for me pink dress with ruffles, bows and lace all together is too much. But you never know, I might wake up tomorrow and be in the mood for looking like a 1980\u2019s prom queen *Images courtesy of popcultureafternoon.blogspot.com .

Or had the thought that if you wear all designer and expensive clothing then you must look good? Well think again\u2026 Ugly Betty has made it very clear that it\u2019s possible to wear Marc Jacobs, Tracy Reese, Alice and Olivia, and even See by Chloe and make them look absolutely hideous. Ever since the first episode aired we have all loved to watch in awe as Betty commits one fashion faux pas after another. Kind of like a train wreck where you don\u2019t want to look but just can\u2019t get yourself to turn away. After deciding to explore the sources of her clothing even further, once again, it became even more clear to me that Betty should be considered a fashion icon. Not in the sense that she is super stylish but because she is living and breathing proof that it\u2019s not what you wear but how you wear it. Can\u2019t wait for some more of her iconic looks in the seasons to come! *Images courtesy of ugly-is-in.com and people.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intution Inc.",

I love how they took the trend to the next level by adding an unexpected twist of tint. The usual hue suspects of fringe are black, brown and tan, so seeing something unique is great!

        "October 28, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview It takes a lot of guts to change majors in your last year , and pursue a degree in something you\u2019re more passionate about. But that\u2019s what our next Chic Interviewee, Lisa Holowaychuk, did. After realizing that her heart lied with fashion, she dumped her Social Work degree and headed towards Consumer Science with Specialization in Clothing Management. Not only does this Canadian beauty, who calls South Africa her home, have a lot to offer but her blog boasts a stylish sensibility like no other. Take a look at what she had to say: Chic Intuition: Why did you decide to start a blog? Lisa: Passion. Inspiration. Love. After months of toying with the idea and building up a ridiculous amount of blogs on my favorites tab, I knew my passions could not stay caged much longer\u2026 I witnessed such a brilliant community of bloggers and felt their energy and passions through the screen. I guess you could say it was contagious. Chic Intuition: If you were given the role of creating \u2018Lisa\u2019s Fashion Timeline\u2019, how would you categorize each era? Lisa: Oh dear. If only I could attach pictures to these eras. You guys would have such a great laugh. Here is my wonderful journey through my ever-evolving style. Chic Intuition: On average, how long does is take you to put an outfit together? Lisa: I have to admit I do not really give it too much thought, so on average I would say about five minutes. Number one- weather, number 2- mood, number 3-occasion and number 4- inspiration (I have a cork board which houses my current clippings). So with that set, I simply pull out couple pieces and start from there. But on lazy days, it\u2019s worn in boyfriend\u2019s jeans and a plaid, 10 seconds flat! Chic Intuition: If you had to categorize your style, what would you call it? Lisa: Simplicity coupled with a lot of masculine influence (leather, baggy denims, button downs) and the forever feminine touch, which every female around the world interprets and expresses in their own unique way. Chic Intuition: One accessory you can\u2019t live without. Lisa: Hands down a bag. It can be anything really: a clutch, shopper, satchel, messenger, briefcase\u2026 I love them all. Let\u2019s admit it; we stash our life into these babies, so without them we would be lost. Chic Intuition: Does the outfit make the person, or the person makes the outfit? Lisa: Without a doubt the person makes the outfit. I know this has been said a gazillion times, but style genuinely comes from the inside. It does not matter if you\u2019re wearing Gucci or Gap; if you don\u2019t feel secure in who you are from within, you will never truly feel complete. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: How dark is too dark? Lisa: If it is too dark to see a smile, then it is too dark. *Images courtesy of lesselooks.com .

Now, what better than to start off with the easiest to pull off (and least expensive) trend: makeup! A lot of our fave designers opted to go with the fresh-faced route. The key here is to go minimal and natural on all aspects of your face. The best way to pull this look off is to have healthy skin, so we recommend that you take part in a daily ritual of moisturizing, if you don\u2019t already. As for products, a rosy blush, sheer gloss, and tinted foundation are the 3 mains. Honestly you can find all of these products at your local pharmacy, but if you have the urge to splurge, then try these products: *Images courtesy of style.com .

Of course, the fact that Alexa Chung was spotted donning them on the cover of UK VOGUE might have also helped the matter. We\u2019re actually starting to warm up to this trend, with a few outfit modifications in mind. Since we all can\u2019t afford the Chanel\u2019s, why not opt for similar versions for less ?

I\u2019m from Australia so it is winter at the moment. I added an image of the top I want to wear. Thanks so much. Looking forward to hearing from you. PS: Love your blog!\u201d Well Maddy, first off thanks for the compliment, and secondly l.o.v.e the fact that you want to glimmer on your B-Day. Special occasions are the best times to don some sparkle, and we imagined your top with countless outfit options. It was quite hard, but we managed to filter it down to two options. The main theme was to add some black, since the sparkles are enough shine. Also, like you mentioned, it\u2019s winter in Australia so throw on a leather biker jacket or a fitted blazer for warmth. You can opt to pair the tunic with leggings and colored pumps, or partially tuck it into a high-waisted skirt. Hope you like the options! *Images courtesy of net-a-porter.com .

I\u2019ve been trying to find something similar to the Olsen\u2019s Alaia belt for ages. Any suggestions?\u201d Well Holly, the belt you adore really is fabulous. And usually something with that much fabulosity is rare. What we\u2019ve managed to do is find you an option that carries a similar form and will basically do you the same justice as the Alaia.

        "December 24, 2012 | Tags: Chic Interview It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve last interviewed a fashionista, and we feel like we\u2019ve chosen just the right person to break our dry spell. Soraya Bakhtiar, an Iranian/Egyptian who resides in Switzerland has the perfect mixture of eclectic cultures, taste, and fashion know how to fit our chic bill. Her blog is so addictive, we\u2019re sure you will be going back for more once you get a taste of her stylish sensibility \u2026 Chic Intuition: We have to start off by saying we were quite impressed with your resume. At just 23 you\u2019ve already conquered the blogosphere while finishing off a Master\u2019s degree in Fashion Journalism. You\u2019ve stated that your ultimate goal is to become a Fashion Editor, how and when did this love for everything style become? Soraya: For as long as I can remember. Growing up I was real girly girl and I always had an interest for fashion. Also, I must say that I was lucky enough to be surrounded by many creative personalities in my family and surrounding, which inevitably made me realize that I wanted to be part of it \u201cwhen I grew up\u201d. I had another blog for two years and shut it down to started my own eponymous blog in May 2012 and decided to put myself forward. Since I\u2019ve moved to London my style really evolved and I feel much more daring today. I\u2019m not scared of mixing prints and textures anymore. Maybe someday I hope to be a fashion or accessories editor, I really enjoyed the experience I had when I worked in magazines like TANK and ELLE UK, but we\u2019ll see \u2013 I\u2019m keeping my options open because so far, I never thought that my blog would take me on such an incredible journey. Chic Intuition: Anyone that follows your blog knows you have a killer wardrobe (cc: your Givenchy boots #killer). Do you usually plan out your seasonal wardrobe with a must have list or just build it as you go along? Soraya: It really depends. Usually I spot key pieces off the runway during fashion week and I know I need to chase them i.e GIVENCHY BOOTS. Otherwise, I just go with the flow and my current cravings and inspiration. Chic Intuition: That leads us to our next cliche (but we gotta ask) question. If your house was burning down (God forbid) what 3 items would you grab from your wardrobe and why? Soraya: Wow! That\u2019s really a tough one. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure that I would grab things from my wardrobe, because at the end of the day they\u2019re just clothes and you don\u2019t take it with you as they say. I would rather save some sentimental objects like my watch that I received for my 20th birthday (or my Birkin bag), my teddy bear that I\u2019ve had since I was born and some family photo albums. These things are priceless. Chic Intuition: Who is your fave fashion designer and why? Soraya: I love Alexander Wang for introducing the whole downtown sporty cool look and Phoebe Philo at Celine for her minimalism elegance. Chic Intuition: If you hadn\u2019t taken a path in fashion, what other career path would you see yourself in? Soraya: I would say a children therapist because I love children and I have a major in Psychology. Chic Intuition: From one blogger to another, we know it\u2019s a pretty hectic life to live that needs a ton of dedication. What advice would you give an aspiring blogger? Soraya: Be true to yourself and find your niche. Every blogger has their own \u201cspecialty\u201d whether it\u2019s stacking up jewelry, mixing prints and textures, or vintage clothes. The sky is the limit. Chic Intuition: We all have a little selfish spot where we discover an unknown fashion brand that we keep to ourselves for a while and hope and pray that no one will discover it. Now it\u2019s your time to spill. Fill in the blank: My fave little kept secret I love are clothes by ________. Soraya: I never keep secrets but my newest crush is Three Floor . Chic Intuition: What was your proudest fashion moment this year? Every day is a proud moment as I get so much positive feedback but if I had to pick one, it would probably be my photo shoot/ feature in Harper\u2019s Bazaar Arabia in October. Chic Intuition: Philosophical question time: to nail art or not to nail art? Soraya: Not to nail art. Unless it\u2019s for a special occasion. I usually find nail art quite tacky. I\u2019m more traditional when it comes to my nails, I like them short and glossy. No matte or glitter finish.",
