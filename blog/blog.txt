b'Story from FashionADVERTISEMENTHow TikTok Became Home To A New Kind Of Fashion InfluencerFrances Sol\xc3\xa1-SantiagocThe year was 2012. Then-teenage blogger Tavi Gevinson sat in the front row at the Dior show in Paris wearing an enormous bow on top of her head, baffling many fashion insiders who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why a 13-year-old had been invited to cover a fashion show (let alone block views of the runway). At the time, before there were influencers, fashion bloggers were the ones donning eccentric looks to fashion shows and commenting on industry happenings and trends with the confidence of a career critic.\xc2\xa0The blogger moment hardly had a chance. Influencers quickly replaced the indie scribes\xe2\x80\x99 hot fashion takes. A cohort of tastemakers that was supposed to democratize fashion gave way to a wave of mini marketers who were open to branded partnerships. By the end of the 2010s, Gevinson shut down Rookie. Leandra Medine\xe2\x80\x99s Man Repeller turned into Repeller, only to close months later. And Bryanboy, one of the original fashion influencers, left his witty blogging for the shinier shores of Instagram.AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTNow, almost a decade later, TikTok is becoming a space where creators are stepping into a time machine that ferries them back to the era of independent commentators. While some might write off the platform as a melting pot of memes and dance-off videos, its spirit is more old-fashioned than some might think. It brims with conversations on sustainability, ethics, trends, fashion history, and design that are often excluded from the traditional influencer landscape that mostly relies on curated images. They\xe2\x80\x99ve traded #ootd for #trendcycle and #personalstyle, inviting their audiences to engage with their content beyond the likes.Sure, TikTok is also full of fashion creators pushing trends, displaying hauls, and sharing their latest press trips. But a different archetype of influencer \xe2\x80\x94 less of a vessel, more of a critic, if you will \xe2\x80\x94 is also emerging on the platform, where personality moves the algorithm more than a pretty filter or sponsorships ever will.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt reminds me of the time before influencers, when the people who were influential were people who had other jobs but they had something to say,\xe2\x80\x9d says Alexandra Hildreth, a TikTok fashion commentator who goes by @guyfieri.superfan.  @guyfieri.superfan he knows how to take her from the WAP music video to thom Browne at the met and RANGE IS KEY ##fyp ##stylist ##cardib ##wap ##mugler ##celebstyle \xe2\x99\xac original sound - guyfieri.superfan   Hildreth works full-time as a project manager at Beyond The Mag, a fashion consulting and creative firm, and lives in Brooklyn. She first downloaded TikTok in January 2020 \xe2\x80\x94 when, according to her, it was \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassing to have TikTok\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and only decided to start commenting on fashion a year later. Since then, her videos filled with unfiltered opinions on designer collections, trends, sustainability, and style have garnered her 1.4 million likes and nearly 44,000 followers. \xe2\x80\x9cI always joke that I can\'t believe people follow me because every single one of my TikToks is like me in my pajamas at seven in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hildreth, whose nom de TikTok is based on a Halloween costume of the platinum-haired chef she wore during her time as an undergraduate at the University of St. Andrews (yes, the Scottish institution where Prince William met Kate Middleton).\xc2\xa0AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTThe unfiltered energy on TikTok is nothing like the hyper-studied still life that is Instagram. Most of the videos feel like one-on-one conversations with a fashion-obsessed bestie. Fashion content on the app is less aspirational and polished than other platforms, which helps creators focus on substance rather than curated fluff, and facilitates the growth of niche communities, like #Cottagecore, which has over 6.6 billion views, and #Altgirl, which has over 1.5 billion views.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSomething I\xe2\x80\x99m really excited about is the rise of subcultures,\xe2\x80\x9d says Agustina Panzoni, an Argentinian TikTok creator who goes by @thealgorythm on the platform. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no mainstream trends, but rather smaller trends happening in different subcultures.\xe2\x80\x9dPanzoni would know. Last year, after losing her work visa, she transitioned from working at WGSN, an American trend forecasting company, to making TikTok videos. Panzoni studied economics in college, and later ventured into forecasting after learning about this field during a trip to Australia Fashion Week. But after losing her job, she\xe2\x80\x99s found a space to pontificate on fashion trends that works on her own terms. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it professionally,\xe2\x80\x9d she told herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it somewhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0  @thealgorythm The layering opportunities \xe2\x9c\xa8 how would you style this? Top by @clarissa.larrazabal  #fashiontrendpredictions #trendtok \xe2\x99\xac Caution - Kaytranada   The magic formula has been to bring her behind-the-scenes knowledge of trend forecasting to the app through video series helping people navigate fashion trends and their cultural significance. Here TikTok\'s motto is \xe2\x80\x9cI find things you like.\xe2\x80\x9d The pay-off is big for Panzoni, who has garnered over 190,000 followers and over 1 million likes in seven months, watching her follower count grow to 100,000 in her first week.\xc2\xa0AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTEven with such a robust\xc2\xa0following, Panzoni is not trying to make a living out of it: \xe2\x80\x9cInfluencer marketing is so saturated that at this point we are using this as a platform to push us professionally.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, what animates her to keep uploading videos is the TikTokerati\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for raw, opinionated, often funny content.Currently, the independence that these creators maintain from brands or affiliate marketing platforms separates them from the bulk of fashion creators out there.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cListen, if I brand I really loved a brand like Prada or Marc Jacobs reached out to me, obviously you\'re not going to say no,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hildreth. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as far as becoming a full-time influencer, who makes a living off sponsorships and placement promotion, that is not something I have an interest in.\xe2\x80\x9d  @mizft ##annawintour ##americanvogue ##vogue ##fyp ##like ##lebronjames ##highfashion ##addisonrae ##dixiedamelio ##metgala ##fashionindustry ##jeans \xe2\x99\xac Blue Blood - Heinz Kiessling & Various Artists   AJ Krakovsky agrees. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever scrolled through his @mizft TikTok channel, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be mad at me, these are just my opinions\xe2\x80\x9d may sound familiar. Krakovsky starts each video with this line, then segues into his raw opinions about everything, from the Kardashians to why Anna Wintour and American Vogue "get on my nerves" and why Selena Gomez is "underrated." Krakovsky started on TikTok in November 2020, after sharing videos of his bad experiences working as a model. Since then, he\xe2\x80\x99s grown over 120,000 followers on the platform and over 5.2 million likes.\xc2\xa0Prior to joining TikTok, though, he was already a fan of fashion critics, especially people like Luke Meagher from the YouTube channel Haute LeMode, who have disrupted the traditional critic format. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m drawn toward people who 100% keep it real,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who know they might get in trouble for doing something but do it anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Even though he could easily monetize his audience, Krakovsky says he\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in filtering his opinions in order to work with brands. In fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s already tried to work with some fashion companies, but has been rejected because \xe2\x80\x9cthey find my content to be controversial.\xe2\x80\x9dIn an industry ruled by access and connections, creators have the talent and unabashed confidence to say what they want, and TikTok is giving them a space to do it. After all, if they have nothing to gain, they have nothing to lose.

b'Story from FashionADVERTISEMENT3 Ways To Wear Shirt Dresses That Are Anything But TraditionalFrances Sol\xc3\xa1-SantiagoPhoto: Courtesy of Burberry. Burberry spring/summer 2023.Summer fashion can be summarized with one statement: grab-and-go. And the ultimate  item to achieve this is the shirt dress. From the beach and errands, to the office and sunset cocktail parties, the shirt dress is a tried-and-true summer staple that\xe2\x80\x99s as versatile as summertime schedules demand.\xc2\xa0Yet, I must admit that, as can happen with any classic, I\xe2\x80\x99ve grown bored of the simple shirt dress. It started to feel more Kate Middleton-goes-to-a-polo-match than fashion-forward. While I still\xc2\xa0 have many in my wardrobe, this summer, I found myself reaching for them less and less. After all, how much innovation can happen with a style that is so straightforward and elementary?\xc2\xa0AdvertisementADVERTISEMENTPhoto: Courtesy of Loewe. Loewe spring/summer 2023. Photo: Courtesy of Miu Miu. Miu Miu spring/summer 2023. Turns out, designers said, \xe2\x80\x9cHold my beer.\xe2\x80\x9d The spring/summer 2023 collections were filled with inventive ways to wear shirt dresses. Looking back to the summer lineups, it was easy to see that the shirt dress still has room for creativity.\xc2\xa0The Miu Miu spring/summer 2023 collection included long-sleeved tops layered on top of each other to form a mini dress, giving the \xe2\x80\x9cno pants\xe2\x80\x9d look a new life and redefining what a \xe2\x80\x9cshirt dress\xe2\x80\x9d can be. Then, there was also the polo shirt fit-and-flare dresses shown by Loewe, which put a quirky spin to the ultra-feminine style. New York-based designer Peter Do, on the other hand, went for an androgynous vibe, deconstructing a menswear-inspired suit by substituting the blazer for a sheer shirt dress on top of black trousers. Burberry also pushed the shirt dress forward via a nylon overcoat with shirt collar.\xc2\xa0With all this inspiration, I set out to find ways to make shirt dresses fun again by trying three styling concepts seen on the spring/summer 2023 runways: utility, deconstructed tuxedo, and the \xe2\x80\x9cno pants\xe2\x80\x9d look.

The shirt dress is one of the easiest ways to try this trend for size. Yet, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to mean sporty. Take, the dress pictured above, a nylon version from Tibi, which I styled with platforms to make the outfit more evening-appropriate than athletic.\xc2\xa0TibiItalian Sporty Nylon Davenport ShirtdressBUY$595.00TibiBrain DeadNylon Utility Shirt DressBUY$245.00Brain DeadWoolrichShirt Dress In Ripstop Crinkle Nylon With ...BUY$299.00WoolrichDeconstructed TuxedoGiven tuxedo dressing is a top fashion trend for 2023, deconstructing menswear-inspired details is one of the best ways to adapt the shirt dress for the rest of summer, as well as the impending fall transitional outfits. While designers like Peter Do opted for a sheer shirt dress to transform a suit, I decided to wear a crisp white shirt dress with a necktie styled as a scarf.
